All 41 killed on the C-118A, six on the P2V and one woman on the ground who was hit by debris outside her house. Pilot error, pilots of both aircraft.The first takeoff attempt ended in an aborted takeoff due to engine boosting. This was not uncommon with this type of aircraft at higher altitudes and was usually caused the thrust being opened too fast. The second attempt to take off was aborted for the same reason. During the third attempt, as the plane passed V1 (committed to take off) the plane suddenly decelerated, never became airborne, crashed through the barrier fence, into a house and burst into flames. Eight members of the Manchester United football (soccer) team killed. A German inquiry concluded at an accumulation of ice on the wings was the cause of the accident, blaming the captain for not deicing the plane. Ten years later the British reopened the inquiry and concluded the accident was caused by slush on the last quarter of the runway. The reason other planes had taken off without incident was because they lifted in the air using only two thirds of the runway. The accident plane, because of the engine boosting, went further down the runway to take off. The aircraft was named \"Lord Burghley.\"Radio contact was lost with the military aircraft  thirty minutes after taking off from Naples after the crew reported en route at 6,500 feet and switching to the Rome ATC.

It appeared, the pilot became disoriented and flew the plane into the ground.  Officially: The pilot\\'s decision to undertake a flight in which the likelihood of encountering IFR conditions existed, when he was not certified to fly IFR. Also, deficiencies in the weather briefing and the pilot\\'s unfamiliarity with the instrument which determines the attitude of the aircraft. In later years, a story appeared in the Iowa Globe Gazette in which a pilot, Al Potter, flying in the vicinity of the aircraft that night, claimed he was in contact with the aircraft shortly before it crashed. Potter stated the pilot radioed he had taken on ice and was losing power.While attempting to land in rain and fog at La Guardia Airport, the aircraft descended below the minimum altitude and crashed into the East River. The aircraft struck the water while in shallow descent at 150 mph with its landing gear and flaps extended. Primarily the crash resulted from the failure of the crew to properly monitor essential instruments for determining attitude due to preoccupation with particular aspects of the aircraft and its environment. Limited experience of the crew with this particular type of aircraft. Erroneous setting of the captain\\'s altimeter. Possibly misinterpretation of the altimeter and rate of descent indicator.While on approach, the jet lost its wings and had its engines torn off as it ploughed 300 yards through the woods and landed upside down with trees embedded in the mangled fuselage and burst into flames.

Navigational error. The pilot entered a wrong valley and stalled the fully loaded aircraft while attempting to turn back.The trainee captain attempted a maneuver in disregard of the prescribed limitations of such a maneuver. A two-engine overshoot was attempted at a very low height and below the prescribed minimum speed, when the aircraft was committed to a landing. This resulted in a violent yaw and sharp drop which could not be controlled. The training captain was conversant with the minimum requirements of a two-engine overshoot of the Viscount 815 aircraft but appears to have overestimated his performance.The crew failed to recognize and correct the development of excessive yaw which caused an unintentional rolling maneuver at an altitude too low to permit complete recovery.Nineteen minutes after taking off and while climbing, the aircraft entered a cloud and struck Mt. Monseny. Pilot did not follow prescribed regulations.The aircraft descended below MDA and crashed 5 miles short of the runway while on approach to Asuncion.

Sabotage (explosion of a dynamite bomb aboard) was strongly suspected but could never be proven due to lack of physical evidence.  There is a possibility that there is a connection between this crash and the National Airlines crash of January 6, 1960. No one was charged in either case.Crashed shortly after takeoff, 2.5 miles from Beirut Airport. Navigation error. Possible in-flight fire in the No. 1 engine which induced the pilot to start fire emergency action with a resulting reduction in the rate of turn and the rate of climb.Shortly after taking off the plane experienced a fire warning in the No. 2 engine, shut it down and attempted to return to Midway Airport. During the final approach the aircraft banked in excess of 45 degrees and developed an excessive sink rate. When the aircraft reached the tops of trees its wings were nearly level and its nose was raised in a climbing attitude but the descent continued and the plane crashed one quarter of a mile southeast of the airport. The accident was the consequence of manuvering the aircraft during the turn to final approach in such a manner as to cause a rate of sink from which recovery was not possible. Sometime during the turn the flaps were retracted from 60% to 24% causing a loss of lift.Crashed into Bald Eagle Mountain,13 miles south of Williamsport,  while on an ILS approach to Williamsport.  Probable accidental caging of the fluxgate compass leading to a erroneous heading indication. Captain\\'s failure to execute a timely abandoned approach. There was one passenger who survived.Disappeared en route. Right landing gear found on Moron Island.  Cause undetermined.Crashed into a mountain while en route. Crew error.

Detonation of a dynamite bomb by means of dry cell batteries, in the vicinity of row 7, in the passenger cabin.  The plane continued to fly for a short time after which the fuselage came apart and the plane crashed in a ball of flames. Julian Frank, who had purchased 1 million dollars in insurance, was suspected of committing suicide by detonating the bomb in his lap or under his seat. There is a possibility Frank may have been an unwitting bomb carrier and that this bombing has something to do with the National Airlines crash of November, 16, 1959. No one was charged in either case.Missing, never found.The aircraft crashed and burned in a wooded area, striking the ground in a level attitude. The delayed arming of the engine ice-protection systems while flying through icing conditions, causing eventual flame-out of the four engines. This condition existed for sufficient time to cause a drop in battery electrical energy, preventing the unfeathering and relighting of sufficient engines to maintain flight. The aircraft was then dived in an  effort to attain sufficient airspeed to drive the propellers out of the feathered positions by wind-milling.  At the same time, multiple attempts were made to relight one or more engines. Successful relights were either interrupted by auto-feather action initiated by premature advancing of the throttles prior to complete light up of an engine or prevented by insufficient battery electrical energy. No. 4 engine was eventually  relit and the crew had just successfully relit No. 3 engine when the aircraft crashed.While on a flight from Istanbul to Ankara, Turkey the aircraft crashed while on approach to Esenboga Airport, 6 nm short of the runway.

The carrier\\'s license was revoked 6 weeks after the crash.Went missing en route in the Caribbean Sea.The pilot flew too close to the summit of Mt Ruapehu and due either to turbulence or some pilot maneuver, the starboard propeller struck a rock outcrop on the mountain, bending the blade tips forward and causing vibration, which weakened the wing and led to its rapid structural failure of the aircraft.The aircraft was on a charter flight to Livingstone to pick up United Nations troops on leave and take them back to Elizabethville. It took off from Salisbury Airport, and shortly after take-off suddenly dipped its right wing. After a slow recovery, it climbed away to between 100 - 150 ft and then went into a turn to the left with the port propeller windmilling. This turn continued to get steeper until the aircraft rolled over and dived inverted to the ground . The accident was caused by failure of the pilot to execute a successful single engine forced landing after concluding that there had been a power loss in the port engine. Evidence indicated that a failure of the port engine did not, in fact, occur. The pre-take-off rudder trimmer check was not carried out correctly as laid down in the checklist, and the aircraft took off with full left rudder trim applied. Once airborne this was misinterpreted as port engine failure, and the port propeller was feathered. No apparent action was taken by the pilot to correct the ensuing critical speed yaw.After reaching an altitude of about 100 m, the aircraft lost altitude, collided with a eucalyptus forest and was destroyed.

This would be in keeping with the fact that the dome ring was at maximum low pitch setting, i.e. high rpm and a runway propeller on take-off.About 150 miles from Longreach, fire was reported in No. 1 and 2 engines. While the plane was making an emergency descent, the left wing broke away due to weakening by the fire. After failure of the wing, the plane broke up in mid-air and crashed. Loosened bolts led to the loss of the oil lubricating unit causing the bearings to heat and catching the engines on fire. Subsequently, a locking mechanism was installed on the bolts to prevent any future accidents of this kind.The plane crashed into Salmon Mountain while on approach to Portland. The pilots evidently had agreed to maintain 9,000 feet, but descended instead. The aircraft hit the mountain at the 3,830-foot level of a 4,090-foot ridge.

Most probably the captain suffered a heart attack and the first officer could not regain control of aircraft.Flight 9877 was scheduled to provide crew training for a captain trainee and a flight engineer trainee. In addition the flight engineer instructor was being given a routine proficiency check. The flight departed the ramp at 00:40 with the captain trainee in the left seat and the check captain in the right seat. At 00:43 the crew advised the tower they were ready for takeoff and would like to circle and land on Runway 1. The tower cleared them as requested. The aircraft was observed to make what appeared to be a normal takeoff and departure. At 00:47 the crew reported on base leg for Runway 1, and the controller cleared the flight to land. A subsequent discussion revealed that they would execute a simulated two-engine out approach, execute a full stop landing and then takeoff on runway 19. The tower controller observed Flight 9877 in a shallow left turn on what appeared to be a normal final approach. The degree of bank increased to approximately 60 degrees or greater when the aircraft hit the power lines approximately 2,300 feet short and 1,100 feet west of the runway threshold. The DC-8 crashed into a residential area, destroying several homes and a motel complex. Improper supervision by the instructor and the improper use of flight and power controls by both instructor and the captain trainee during a simulated two-engine out landing approach.Ditched in the ocean 2 km  off shore.Crashed into a mountainside while descending to land at Tamanrasset.

Series of errors by the crew due to intoxication by carbon monoxide fumes. Difficulty in communication between the ATC and crew due to lack of phraseology.The aircraft crashed a during a landing attempt. Loss of power in both starboard engines resulting in control difficulties. Fuel starvation due to inadvertent fuel transfer. Inadvertent fuel transfer in flight on a scale sufficient to involve the risk, after a long flight, of emptying the tank expected to contain sufficient fuel can occur if the fuel selector levers in the cockpit of this type of aircraft are incorrectly positioned by even a small amount. This is easy to do and difficult for the pilot to recognize.Crashed on final approach.Crashed into a residential neighborhood while attempting to return to the airport following an engine failure.The pilot attempted an overshoot maneuver, following the stoppage of the port engine, at too low a speed (below the minimum control speed) resulting in an uncontrollable turn towards the Airport buildings.The pilot became lost and ran out of fuel crashing into a swamp. Wreckage was found in the jungle 10 days later.The plane crashed after an aborted takeoff caused the plane to break apart and catch fire.The flight crashed after an in-flight fire destroyed the pitch control systems. Incorrect installation of a valve caused hot air to ignite hydraulic fluid. The fire resulted from engine bleed air flowing back through the malfunctioning non-return valve and an open air delivery valve, through the auxiliary power unit in a reverse direction, and exiting into the plenum chamber at temperatures sufficiently high to cause the acoustics linings to ignite.A mid-air collision occurred between the two aircraft as they attempted to land at the New River Marine Corps Air Facility located on the grounds of Camp Le Jeune.Tower personnel did not continuously  monitor the approach of the CH-53 in order to take more positive action to prevent the mid-air collision.Ditched into the sea while on approach during a typhoon.

Improper procedures used by crew.The aircraft descended too low and flew into the southern slope of Black Down Hill.  Descended through its assigned altitude for reasons unknown. Actress June Thorburn, 36,  killed.Shortly before reaching V1, the nose gear tire blew causing severe vibration. The crew aborted the takeoff and overran the runway into the sea. Loss of directional control developing from separation of the right nose wheel tread.  Inability to stop within the normally adequate runway distance available due to use of differential braking, impaired performance and an increase in tail wind component and aircraft weight over those used in calculating the aircraft\\'s acceleration /stoping performance.While on the takeoff roll a loud bang was heard as the aircraft passed a Delta plane and the takeoff was aborted. The aircraft overran the runway and crashed and burned. The inability of the TWA crew to abort successfully their takeoff at the speed attained prior to the attempted abort. The abort was understandably initiated because of the first officer\\'s belief that his plane had collided with a Delta aircraft stopped just off the runway. A contributing factor was the action of the Delta crew in advising the tower that their plane was clear of the runway without carefully ascertaining the facts, and when in fact their aircraft was not a safe distance under the circumstances of another aircraft taking off on that runway.The plane climbed to 700 ft. and crashed into the ground. Malfunctioning artificial horizon and compass.The aircraft struck a tree short of the runway during an approach in snow. Procedural errors by the crew during the approach in adverse weather. The visual approach conducted at night and in deteriorating weather conditions without adequate altimeter cross-reference. The approach was conducted using visual reference to partially lighted irregular terrain which may have been conducive to producing an illusionary sense of adequate terrain clearance.The aircraft crashed and burned on a slope of a mountain in light rain and low visibility as it diverted to Nha.Trang from it scheduled landing at Qui Nhon.The cargo plane crashed inverted into a river.The plane flew into 10,500 ft.

The plane was three miles from landing at Madison. Cause undetermined. Singer, Otis Redding, 26, killed, along with his vallet and  four members of his Bar-Kays band. Trumpet player, Ben Cauley was the only survivor.The cargo plane crashed on takeoff. The failure of the crew to perform a pre-takeoff control check resulting in takeoff with the elevators immobilized by a control batten.During poor weather and after a flyby, the pilot requested a Runway 18 approach. The pilot decided to make a visual approach along the middle of 3 diverging roads, which was aligned with the runway. Because of the fog, the pilot began his approach along the third road which extended to the Royal Thai Air Force fuel storage instead of Runway 18. When the aircraft got close to the ground, the pilot realized that he was approaching the wrong road. He tried to initiate a go-around but the aircraft became unstable as he raised the nose slipped to the left and stalled the plane. The No.1 engine hit the ground first, 200 meters from the airport.During the approach to airplane was high above the glide slope. At an altitude of 250 m, 4 km from the runway, the crew added takeoff power and performed  a missed approach. Simultaneously  the right engine lost power. While the crew tried to feather the propeller, the aircraft lost altitude, rolled 40 degrees to the right and struck a snow-covered field about 500 m from the runway.Entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed 92 km from Olekminsk. The cause of the accident could not be determined.Crashed into a mountain south of Dong Ha airfield.The aircraft hit Mt. Tobin 300 ft. below the peak and slid 1,000 ft. down the side of the mountain. Turbulent conditions caused the uncontrolled descent. The Salt Lake control center had, in response to its vector request, informed the crew that there were no storm cells and no reports of icing along the airway being used. As a result, the pilot was unaware that turbulence encountered would be hazardous, worse than that predicted at the time of take-off. These turbulent conditions apparently caused the uncontrolled descent of the aircraft into the ground. The pilot was technically not qualified for the type of aircraft and was aware of the general weather conditions and should have discontinued the flight..Ice accretion on the lifting surface of the aircraft accompanied by moderate to severe turbulence, which resulted in loss of aircraft control by the pilot. When he tried to regain control over the aircraft the lifting surfaces were loaded beyond approved design limits, which brought about the disintegration of main parts of the aircraft in the air, and its subsequent impact with the ground.Touched down on the right side of the runway, bounced, crashed into landing lights and into the sea.  Inadequate supervision of the flight by the pilot-in-command. While attempting to go-around, the flaps were fully extended.Visual reference was lost in fog after the flare and prior to touchdown.

The pilot did not follow the correct departure procedure of turning out towards the ocean after takeoff.The aircraft was believed to have gone into a spin or spiral dive with recovery at about 12,000 ft. The dive apparently caused structural damage which resulted in the aircraft plunging into St George\\'s Channel, 10 miles east of Carnsore Point. Possible causal factors may have been metal fatigue, corrosion, flutter (vibration) or a bird strike.Midair collision. Both planes were in a landing pattern. The collision resulted in damage to the DC9\\'s wing with fuel pouring out but the plane was able to make a safe landing.  Two killed on the Cessna, no one killed on the DC-9.  Inadequacy of current VFR standards. The DC-9 crew not sighting the Cessna in time to avoid it. Congested traffic pattern.Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, 34, the first man in space, was killed along with his instructor, when the military fighter they were training in crashed approximately 30 miles east of Moscow.Shortly after leaving the runway during takeoff the No. 2 engine caught fire.

While completing a last turn to join the approach path, control was lost and the airplane crashed in a field located few km from the airport.The aircraft crashed en route after the pilot transmitted a Mayday reporting the failure of the No. 2 engine and inability to feather the propeller. It crashed 20 miles from the airfield it intended to make an emergency landing at.The aircraft crashed into Moose Mountain during an approach. Execution of a non-standard approach.  Premature descent. The crew was not able to determine accurately its position because they had performed a non-standard instrument approach and there were no supplement navigational aids available for their use.The plane landed in the shallow waters of San Francisco Bay, 2.5 mile short of the Runway 28L. All 107 people aboard were safely evacuated off the plane without injury. According to the NTSB, the captain said he was making a coupled approach, but because of problems with his pressure altimeter, he was relying on the more accurate radio altimeter for verification of altitude. The captain looked up expecting to be 200 feet above the water but instead was nearly in the water. He applied power but it was too late. The captain did not cross-check the raw data glide-slope signals and didn\\'t realize the ILS on-course position was far above where he was. The  improper application of the prescribed procedures to execute an automatic-coupled ILS approach. This deviation from the prescribed procedures was, in part, due t o a lack of familiarization and infrequent operation of the installed flight director and autopilot system.  As a result, Japan Air Lines changed their training procedures to stress command responsibilities, crew coordination and transition time for new type of aircraft. The aircraft was recovered from the San Francisco Bay 55 hours after the accident, repaired at a United Air Lines facility and eventually flow back to Japan where it was put  in service for many decades.While on approach to the airport, in dense fog, the aircraft descended prematurely and its left wing clipped a 30 ft. light pole on the grounds of a fire station 1.8 miles northwest of the runway threshold. The plane then veered into the adjacent elevated western embankment of a freeway and broke up, spewing flaming wreckage across all six traffic lanes. Improper IFR operation. Misjudged altitude.Crashed shortly after taking off after one of the engines failed.Broke up in severe turbulence at 11,500 feet. Failure of the right wing that was weakened by pre-existing fatigue cracks.  The turbulence was not forcast and not known to the flight crew.  Improper maintenance. Incorrect weather forcast.En route from New York City, the airliner crashed in the Caribbean sea and exploded while descending for a landing  at Maiquetia Airport. Possible sensory illusion produced by the town lights on upslope.

Continuation of the descent below minimum descent altitude into obstructing terrain while both pilots were looking outside to establish visual reference to the ground. Improper IFR operation. Misread or failed to read instruments.The cargo plane crashed after a go-around was attempted in a snowstorm. Pilot in command continued VFR flight into adverse weather conditions and delayed in initiating go around. Weather conditions - down and up drafts.The stickshaker sounded shortly after VR. The aircraft rotated and climbed slowly.  The right wing contacted the snow covered ground 94 feet left of the extended centerline at a distance of 2,760 feet from the runway.  The aircraft rolled inverted and broke up.  The probable cause was an attempted takeoff with the flaps in a retracted position. This resulted from a combination of factors: a) inadequate cockpit checklist and procedures; b) a warning system inadequacy associated with cold weather operations; c) ineffective control practices regarding manufacturer\\'s Service Bulletins; and d) stresses imposed upon the crew by their attempts to meet an air traffic control deadline.Crashed into a mountain after being blown off course by a storm while en route.The aircraft crashed during an instrument approach after a go-around, nearly inverted, into a hangar. Spacial disorientation of the crew precipitated by refraction of the landing or approach lights during transition from flying IFR to visual reference to the ground.Struck the slope of a mountain west of Soto la Marina in marginal weather,Last radio contact  from the aircraft was at 11:34 local 30 DME south of Port Hedland in moderate turbulence. The aircraft was seen descending rapidly. Wreckage was found 28 miles south of Port Hedland. The accident was caused by a crack originating at a bolt hole in the wing spar. Also, it was found that someone  had carried out an incorrect procedure on the spar, by forcing an oversize bush into the housing of the lower spar boom, resulting in damage which exacerbated the spread of the hairline fracture.The helicopter crashed into the water after a uncontrolled descent. Moisture in the servo cylinder vent ports froze causing the pilot valves ports to become inoperative causing the  pitch control to lock-up.Encountered extreme turbulence and downdrafts while en route near mountains.The aircraft descended below the glide slope and crashed into trees and a house short of the runway.  Incorrect setting of flaps and instruments.  The pilot inadvertently allowing the aircraft to descend below the glide slope during the final stage of an approach to land until it was too low for recovery to be effected.Crashed, clipping tree tops short of the runway, in light snow while on approach. An excessive descent was not detected or corrected by the crew for reasons unknown. Possibilities include an altimeter failure or misreading of the instrument approach chart.The aircraft was on approach to 07R when it crashed into Santa Monica Bay 6 miles short of the runway. The fuselage  broke into 3 pieces one of which floated for 20 hours. SAS did not authorize a back course approach to LAX.  A VOR approach was conducted without notifying the controlling authority. The crew was preoccupied with a landing gear light problem. Lack of crew coordination and inadequate monitoring of aircraft position which resulted in an unplanned descent into the water. The aircraft was named \"Sverre Viking.\"Struck a mountain in poor weather while en route.The aircraft crashed into Santa Monica Bay shortly after a night takeoff in poor weather and visibility. The aircraft was dispatched with the No. 3 generator inoperative. While this was allowed, United was required to repair the generator at the first airport where there were repair facilities. The aircraft flew for a total of 41 hours with the inoperative generator passing through airports that had the facilities to repair the generator. Soon after taking off, the crew reported a fire warning in the No. 1 engine and shut it down as required. For reasons that could not be determined, shutting down the No. 1 engine and itâ\\x80\\x99s generator tripped the No.2 generator resulting in the loss of all electrical power in the aircraft. Following loss of all electrical power, the battery standby electrical system either was not activated or failed to function. Electrical power at a voltage level of approximately 50 volts was restored approximately a minute and a half after loss of the No. 2 generator. The duration of this power restoration was just 9 to 15 seconds. Regardless, the pilots did not have functioning attitude indicators from the time the No. 2 generator tripped. In the dark, with no outside or inside reference to guide them, the pilots became spatially disoriented and the plane eventually went into a dive and crashed into the Pacific Ocean 11.3 miles west of the airport and sank in 950 ft. of water. The accident was caused by the loss of attitude orientation during a night, instrument departure in which all attitude instruments were disabled by loss of electrical power. The investigation was not able to determine (a) why all generator power was lost or (b) why the standby electrical power system either was not activated or failed to function.\" One unproven scenario that is not contradicted by available evidence was the inadvertent placement of the battery switch to the \"OFF\" position by the flight engineer during attempts to remove galley loads from the generator buses. The galley switches were similar in shape and size, and were located on the flight engineer\\'s upper panel in close proximity to the battery switch. Following the accident, the flight engineerâ\\x80\\x99s panel was redesigned to place a guard over the battery switch.The flight designated \"gambler\\'s special\" flew into  Mt. Whitney at 11,770 ft. about 11 miles west of Lone Pine.

New engines were installed in the CH-53s to increase the power of the main rotor and on a whole to make the helicopter more powerful. However, it was soon evident that the tail rotor could not balance the increased power created by the main rotor. Under certain conditions the aircraft would become unstable and lose directional heading. Sikorsky warns of these conditions. To compensate for the mistake that had been made, Sikorsky designed and tested a bell crank system to stabilize the rear rotor. After seven years, this helicopter was still not retrofitted with the bell crank system. Gross weight of the container exceeded the lifting capacity of the helicopter.

An engine failure was followed by a wide banking turn and crash to the ground bursting into flames.The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Richland after climbing to 400 feet and stalling. Crew error.  The failure and inability of the flightcrew to prevent rapid pitchup and stall by exerting sufficient push force on the control wheel. The pitchup was caused by the combination of a mistrimmed horizontal stabilizer and a center of gravity near the aircraft\\'s aft limit. The mistrimmed condition resulted from discrepancies in the aircraft\\'s trim system and the flightcrew\\'s preoccupation with making a timely departure. The out-of-trim warning system was inoperative.The aircraft touched down just as the crew noticed a snow plow on the runway. A go-around was initiated but the thrust reverses did not stow away properly because hydraulic power was automatically cut off at lift-off.

Failure of the crew to monitor altitude and descent rate and the failure of the 1st officer to provide the captain with the required altitude and approach performance call-outs. Also the flight engineer disabled the GPWS alarm so the crew could hear one another better. In addition, the night flight had been diverted from its primary airport due to poor weather and was required to execute a compressed approach (descending and approaching more quickly and steeply than normal), and the crucial altimeter readout was an old drum-roll-counter type (due to be replaced), which could easily be misread, especially in  heavy workload situations.

Unfamiliarity of the crew with the landing field and lack of planning for the flyby.The civilian Iranian airliner was shot down by the U.S. Navy vessel U.S.S. Vincennes with surface-to-air missiles. The Vincennes was protecting other civilian ships in the area from Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes responded to hostile action taking place against a ship by Iranian gun boats. However, orders to the captain were to send a helicopter to investigate but maintain position. In fact, the ship headed towards the hostilities and penetrated 2nm inside Iranian territorial waters and after the helicopter was fired upon, engaged the enemy boats. The ill-fated airliner was delayed in leaving Bandar Abbas because of a problem with the passport of a passenger. Soon after taking off the target appeared on the radar of the Vincennes. Because the plane was late and confusion of time zones, the crew was not expecting an airliner in the area. When the target was first identified, it squawked both 2 (military) and 3 (civilian). The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft. At the inquiry computer data showed that the plane was never descending and actually was ascending at a steady rate. Incredibly, a military investigation concluded that although the U.S. government regretted the loss of human life, the captain and crew were not at fault and acted properly in shooting down the airliner.Shortly after taking off the crew of the cargo plane experienced failure of the No. 4 engine and a fire.

Non-standard phraseology used by Kuala Lumpur ATC, causing the crew to misinterpret the instructions.After leaving Honolulu, on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, the loss of an improperly latched forward lower lobe cargo door resulted in explosive decompression and loss of power in the No. 3 and 4 engines. Nine passengers were sucked out of the plane and lost at sea. The plane landed safely. The cargo door opening was attributed to a faulty switch or wiring in the door control system which permitted electrical actuation of the door latches towards the unlatched position after initial door closure and before takeoff. As a failsafe, the latches should have been blocked from moving by a mechanism called a \"locking sector\" (one on each latch), engaged manually by a lever after the door is closed.  However, the locking sectors as designed were not strong enough and could be overcome by the motors which was a design flaw right from the introduction of the747.  This was finally recognized as serious, after a non-fatal failure in 1987, but installing stronger locking sectors required taking each plane out of service 10 hours, and the FAA had allowed airlines 18 months so they could do it during other maintenance procedures.The cargo plane crashed after its initial climb. Icing.Crashed after striking radio tower while on approach.While flying from Thunder Bay, Ontario to Winnipeg, Manitoba, the plane crashed on take-off from Dryden, Ontario. The aircraft failed to gain altitude, settled back down on the runway and then took off for a second time clipping the tops of  trees, causing debris to clog the engines leading to the plane crashing. The aircraft was being refueled with one engine running because of an unserviceable APU. Since no external power unit was available at the airport the engine could not be shut down and deicing could not be performed. The captain\\'s decision to take off  in deteriorating weather conditions with an accumulation of snow and ice on the wings.  Decision not to de-ice the plane before taking off. The failure of the Canadian air transport system in placing the crew in a situation where they did not have the resources to make a proper decision.While landing the cargo plane pitched down and crashed short of the runway. A loss of control due to the improper in-flight decisions by the crew and the undetected accumulation of ice on the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer, during flight in a forward centre of gravity condition and exacerbated by the extension of full landing flaps.The loss of control of the airplane for undetermined reasons following the in-flight opening of the improperly latched cargo door. Contributing to the accident were inadequate procedures used by Evergreen Airlines and approved by the FAA for pre-flight verification of external cargo door lock pin manual control handle, and the failure of McDonnell Douglas to provide flight crew guidance and emergency procedures for an in-flight opening of the cargo door. Also contributing to the accident was the failure of the FAA to mandate modification to the door-open warning system for DC-9 cargo-configured airplanes, given the previously known occurrences of in-flight door openings.Crashed and burned in mountainous terrain during a troop lift mission.

The crew was working with a filight plan that showed the course in tenths of a degree  instead of in the usual whole degrees. When the flight plan indicated 0270 degrees, the crew should have been flying at 027 degrees. Instead they flew at 270 degrees (west).Therefore, the crew flew in  the wrong direction, even though Belem was north of Maraba and the sun was setting right in front of them. Then they assumed they had overshot Belem and flew straight back east. Then they began following a river which they assumed was the Amazon which would lead them to Belem, but it was the Xingu river. Finally, they  tuned in a radio station and homed in on it assuming it was a Belem station, which it wasn\\'t.The aircraft crashed into navigational towers and residential houses shortly after takeoff in heavy rain and high winds. Decision of the pilot in command  to fly after an abrupt deterioration in weather conditions.The aircraft crashed into the sea after an in-flight breakup. Severe vibration caused by worn bolts causing the rudder to jam and the tail to collapse. Bolts used to attach the fin to the fuselage were found to be counterfeit and wore much faster that genuine bolts.  Official PC: The accident was caused by loss of control due to the destruction of primary control surfaces in the tail section, which, in turn, was caused by aeroelastic oscillations initiated by abnormal clearances in the vertical stabilizer attachments to the fuselage structure. The condition of the attachments was a result of excessive wear in pins and sleeves used in this structural joint. The pins and sleeves were of an inferior quality and did not satisfy specified values for hardness and tensile strength. They had also been installed and inspected using sub-standard maintenance procedures. Undamped oscillations in the elevator contributed to the structural failure of the empennage.\"Crashed into trees while attempting to land at night, in fog.

He was not aboard the flight.The aircraft was making a night, VOR instrument approach to Runway 28.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, except for some parts of the airport which were obscured by low cloud.  Approaching Runway 28, the aircraft was too high to land and the pilot chose instead to enter a right downwind to land on Runway 10.  At approximately 400 feet above ground level on final for Runway 10, the aircraft entered some clouds, the base of which were reported by the tower operator to be at 10 meters.  The aircraft continued its descent, initially striking some trees about 400 feet short of the runway, then shearing off one of the main landing gear on a hillside road about 200 feet prior to the runway.  The aircraft, under full power and nose up, began to climb, but rolled inverted and crashed at the threshold of Runway 10.  The wing fuel tanks were ruptured and the fuselage, trailing fire, slid across the runway and stopped on the parallel taxiway.  A fire ensued and airport fire and rescue crews put out the fire within 10 minutes.  Both pilots and one passenger were killed by impact and the remaining four passengers were taken to the hospital with moderate injuries.

Ringani after being diverted en route to Denpasair, Bali, due to bad weather.The aircraft was put in a series of extended holding patterns as it approached New York.The crew informed ATC they were running out of fuel but did not declare an emergency and were cleared to land. After a missed approach and during  a go-around, the plane ran out of fuel and crashed in a wooded area. The captain speaking very little English and communicating through the first officer, at no time declared an emergency. The first officer used the term \"we need priority\" several times, rather than declaring an emergency. The ATC did not realize the peril of the aircraft. Failure of the crew to properly communicate the emergency situation to the ATC. Although blame was placed squarely on the crew there are several reasons why ATC should have  taken some responsibility for the accident. ATC was trying to land too many planes at once given the weather and number of missed approaches and aborted landing that were taking place. The plane was put in an extended holding pattern on three different occasions. The crew was not told of wind shear below 500 ft. which led to the aborted landing attempt. The plane was passed between three different controllers as it came out of its holding pattern to land. Each time the crew had to repeat their fuel situation.  The crew did say \"we are running out of fuel\" numerous times only to be taken on a wide circling pattern after the first attempt at landing was aborted. Although the major blame was placed on the crew, in the end, the FAA paid 40% of compensations to the passenger\\'s families.The Antonov crashed after failing to find the destination airport at night.Rain and high winds caused the aircraft to crash 50 miles from it\\'s destination of Brazzaville.In light snow, the cargo plane was unable to gain altitude and crashed into trees.

Primary cause was impaired judgment, decision-making, and flying abilities of the captain and flight crew due to the effects of fatigue.A sudden pitch-up during approach led the crew to go-around.  The pitch-up continued until the plane stalled and crashed.  Improperly loaded baggage shifted the center of gravity beyond the acceptable limit.While taking off, the aircraft, overloaded by 3 times the number of people the plane was designed for, never got airborne, overran the runway and crashed into the Pyanj river. The crew was coerced into taking off by armed men who commandeered the plane.The aircraft skidded off  the end of the runway while landing. The crew was made aware of windshear at approach end of runway but not of poor water drainage on the runway nor a change in wind direction. A very light touch of the runway surface with the landing gear and lack of compression of the left landing gear leg to the extent understood by the aircraft computer as the actual landing, resulted in delayed deployment of spoilers and thrust reversers. The delay was about 9 seconds. Thus, the braking commenced with delay and in a condition of heavy rain and strong tailwind the aircraft did not stop on the runway. The aircraft was named \"Kulbach.\"Crashed into the sea. Shot down with a missile by Abkhazi separatist rebels.The aircraft was hit by a missile then crash landed on the runway. Terrorist act  by Abkhazian rebels.The plane was on a senic flight of the Mt. Cook area and impacted Franz Josef Glacier at 4,500 ft. The aircraft became trapped in a narrow valley and as the pilot attempted to turn around within the valley the aircraft stalled while it was in a steep bank.While landing during a rainstorm, the aircraft went off the end of the runway, into a swamp, collapsing the landing gear and breaking the fuselage into three sections.The aircraft descended below minima during a localizer approach, without a glideslope, struck the top of trees and crashed into a swamp in heavy rain showers and strong winds.The aircraft took off and made a low right turn, struck trees and crashed. The crew most likely lost situational awareness and as a result did not detect the increasing deviation from their intended flight path. Contributing factor was the loss of AC power to some of the flight instruments the reason for which could not be determined.The plane crashed short of the runway while landing in dense fog, hitting power lines and a wall. The autopilot disconnected during approach and re-engaged with the vertical speed mode at 800ft/min.Crashed while in a holding pattern and after running out of fuel. The crew did not follow a standard holding pattern.The airliner crashed and exploded after an aborted landing at Ohrid Airport. The aircraft was diverted to Ohrid because of bad weather. Violation of airport traffic pattern. The flight had earlier carried out a missed approach but the crew had reportedly failed to follow the normal procedure and as a result lost situational awareness. The VOR beacon not working. Misunderstanding because air traffic controller spoke Macedonian while the crew used Russian and English in their transmissions.While on approach, the aircraft collided with trees and terrain 3 miles from the runway threshold in fog and freezing drizzle. Delay by the captain to start the descent which led to a breakdown in crew coordination and the loss of altitude awareness by the flightcrew during an unstabilized approach in night instrument meteorological conditions.Four minutes after taking off the pilot reported he was having engine problems and was returning. The aircraft subsequently crashed onto a frozen lake, 7.7nm from the airfield in darkness.Midair collision. The Twin Otter, which was descending inbound to Dakar, collided with a Gambia Airways aircraft which had just taken off. The Twin Otter crashed into the sea. Failure to maintain assigned altitude. Three killed aboard the Twin Otter. The YS-11 was able to land safely.Crashed on approach to Phongsavanh Airport after striking trees in heavy fog.Flew into the side of Mt. Manase at 2,000 ft., 21nm from the airport  during a VOR approach to Naga. The pilot descended too low in heavy rain and zero visibility.The aircraft stalled and crashed in fog when the tail struck the runway as the pilot attempted a go-around as it landed at Gyumri.The plane crashed during takeoff following a fire in the No. 2 engine and subsequent loss of the two remaining engines. Faulty air starter unit. Crew took off ignoring the \"starter warning light\" thinking it was false.  The crew underestimated the severity of the situation due to shortcomings in the operational documentation.  Breakup of the No.2 engine starter, damaging fuel and oil lines and causing a fire.The aircraft stalled 1.2 miles east of runway 28L during an ILS approach. An aerodynamic stall occurred when the flightcrew allowed the airspeed to decay to stall speed following a poorly planned and executed approach characterized by an absence of procedural discipline. Improper pilot response to the stall warning including failure to advance the power levers to maximum and inappropriately raising the flaps. Flightcrew\\'s inexperience in a  \"glass cockpit\" automated aircraft.While on approach the nose pitched up, the aircraft stalled and crashed short of the runway. Icing of the horizontal stabilizer.The cargo plane struck trees and high terrain after losing three engines during severe icing. Multiple engine failures occurred as a result of flight in extreme icing conditions. Incomplete performance of the emergency drills by the crew, as a result of not referring to the Emergency Checklist, prejudiced the chances of successful engine re-starts. Crew actions for securing and re-starting the failed engines, which were not in accordance with the operator\\'s procedures, limited the power available. The drag from two unfeathered propellers of the failed engines and the weight of the heavily iced airframe resulted in a loss of height and control before the chosen diversion airfield could be reached. Poor Crew Resource Management reduced the potential for emergency planning, decision making and workload sharing. Consequently, the crew had no contingency plan for the avoidance of the forecast severe icing conditions, and also was unaware of the relative position of a closer diversion airfield which could have been chosen by making more effective use of air traffic services.The plane struck Cerro Carpich at 4,000 ft., 6 minutes after leaving the airport at Tingo Maria.The aircraft overran the runway and came to rest at the edge of the east river, after an aborted takeoff. Failure to turn on the pilot/static heat system resulting in erroneous air speed indication. Though heavily damaged, the plane was repaired and put back into service.Crashed during touch-and-go exercises. Application of wrong rudder by trainee pilot  during engine failure exercise. Captain did not guard/block the rudder control and give clear commands as instructor so as to obviate the application of wrong rudder control by the trainee pilot.Crashed into sea after a shell exploded in one of the gun barrells.Shot down with a missile by Armenian forces while en route.After discharging passengers the sea plane took off, the nose pitched up and crashed. Failure of the pilot-in-command to assure the bilges were adequately pumped free of water, which resulted in the aft center of gravity limit to be exceeded, and failure of the aircrew to follow the checklist. A factor related to the accident was the water leak.The cargo plane lost a right engine during takeoff. The plane tried to return to the airport but crashed. The failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain airspeed. Factors to the accident were: cylinder fatigue, dark night and stall encountered.Lost an engine while taking off and then lost a second engine and crashed 1,300 ft. beyond the runway.The aircraft crashed after a captain allowed his child to manipulate the controls of the plane. The pilot\\'s 11 year old daughter and 16 year old son were taking turns in the pilot\\'s seat. While the boy was flying, he inadvertently disengaged the autopilot linkage to the ailerons and put the airliner in a bank of 90 degrees which caused the nose to drop sharply. The co-pilot pulled back on the yoke to obtain level flight but the plane stalled. With his seat pulled all the way back, the co-pilot in the right hand seat could not properly control the aircraft. After several stalls and rapid pull-ups the plane went into a spiral descent. In the end the co-pilot initiated a 4.8g pull-up and nearly regained a stable flight path but the aircraft struck the ground in an almost level attitude killing all aboard. The aircraft was named Glinka, after Mikhail Glinka, the father of Russian music.The helicopter crashed shortly after takeoff. The ingestion of foreign material (snow) in the engine, which resulted in a flameout (loss of engine power). Factors related to the accident were: the adverse weather conditions (snow falling & high density altitude), the lack of snow covers to protect the engine intakes while parked and awaiting for the weather conditions to improve, improper planning/decision by the pilot and the company/operator management, inadequate information in the flight manual, and the lack of suitable terrain for an emergency landing.Shortly after taking off, due to a false warning light, the captain idled one engine (contrary to the checklist) and  assumed they had an engine problem and returned to the airport. While attempting to land, the aircraft rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and crashed. Inadequate use of the flight controls during an asymmetric go-around resulting in loss of control. Contributing factors were insufficient understanding of the flightcrew of the SAAB 340B engine oil system, lack of awareness of the consequences of an aircraft configuration with one engine in flight idle and poor crew resource management.Shot down by a missile. President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira and president of Rwanda, Juvenal Habyarimana were killed.Struck Mt. Lozan, at 13,400 ft. which was obscured by clouds 47 minutes after taking off. Controlled flight into terrain.Shot down by friendly fire during the Gulf War. Thirteen killed on each helicopter.Crashed into Mt. Saran 30 minutes before it was scheduled to land in poor weather condtions.While on ILS approach to Nagoya Airport, at an altitude of 1,000 feet, the first officer inadvertently triggered the TOGA (take-off-go-around) lever. The crew tried to override this situation by turning off the autothrottle and reducing air speed. The aircraft stalled, hit the runway tail first and burst into flames. The plane crashed because of an extreme out of trim configuration brought about by the fact that the tailplane setting had moved automatically and undetected to a maximum nose-up position. The plane climbed at a steep angle until it stalled. The crew could have saved the aircraft even in the final seconds had they reverted to basic flight procedures and switched off the autopilot.The aircraft was destroyed when it undershot the runway during a visual approach to Sao Gabriel and stuck trees.Crashed while making an emergency landing following engine trouble.Crashed shortly after taking off after double engine failure.The helicopter crashed into The Mountain of the Stone Slab at an elevation of 800 ft. Pilot error in proceeding towards high ground in heavy fog below a safe altitude.The plane broke-up in flight 10 minutes after taking off. Auto-pilot induced oscillations caused the aircraft to shake violently. The autopilot yaw-channel was accidentally connected to the bank control and the bank-channel to the yaw controls.The aircraft flew into high ground during a go-around. The accident happened in darkness and in poor weather with rain and heavy clouds. The accident was attributed to the pilot\\'s failure to follow the established go-around procedure correctly.The aircraft struck Mt. Kalora at 2,300 feet while on a visual approach to Palu. The accident happened in generally good weather but with reduced visibility in clouds and haze at the mountain.The aircraft crashed in poor weather conditions 0.8 nm south of the threshold of runway 1R at Dulles International Airport while attempting a ILS landing. Poor airmanship and relative inexperience of the captain in initiating and continuing an unstabilized instrument approach that led to a descent below the authorized altitude without visual contact with the runway environment. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the lack of a GPWS on the airplane.Crashed on approach 3 miles short of the runway into a wooded area with flaps and landing gear still retracted.Shot down by Afghan troops.The plane crashed after demonstrating a simulated engine failure on takeoff. Caused by a number of factors relating to the test and actions of the crew none of which singley would have caused the crash. Unexpected mode transition to altitude acquire mode during a simulated  engine failure resulted in excessive pitch, loss of airspeed, and loss of control. Pitch attitude protection not provided in altitude acquire mode.The plane crash landed on the runway in adverse weather, after a second landing attempt, breaking the landing gear and sliding off the side of the runway.The aircraft crashed into trees and a private residence after a  missed approach during adverse weather conditions. Microburst induced windshear. Crew\\'s inability to recognize windshear and microburst conditions.  The flightcrew\\'s decision to continue an approach into severe convective activity that was conducive to a microburst. The flightcrew\\'s failure to recognize a windshear situation in a timely manner. The flightcrew\\'s failure to establish and maintain the proper airplane attitude and thrust setting necessary to escape the windshear. The lack of real-time adverse weather and windshear hazard information dissemination from air traffic control.The helicopter crashed into the water. All survived but were not equipped with life vests and 3 passengers drowned. Failure of the engine-driven fuel pump, which resulted in the loss of power, and the lack of aircraft flotation equipment. Factors related to the accident were: flight over water adjacent to terrain that afforded no suitable forced landing site, and the lack of a passenger briefing by the operator on the location and operation of life preserversCrashed into high ground while on approach to land.Ran off the end of the runway and crashed. The crew used the normal and emergency brake systems at the same time which resulted in the aircraft having no brakes at all.Crashed on a wooded hillside shortly after taking off from Colon after a bomb exploded aboard.The helicopter crashed 5 minutes after taking off from Kilo Lima.Crashed and burned while attempting to land with an engine fire in poor visibility and heavy rain.Continued VFR flight into IMC.The aircraft overran the runway and caught fire while landing during adverse weather conditions.  The approach was flown with slats/flaps at 15/20 degrees due to suspected windshear. Crew error. There was a struggle and argument between the captain and co-pilot during the last seconds of the landing as to whether they should go-around.The pilot flew into a blind box canyon and crashed while attempting to turn around. Improper in-flight planning /decision by the pilot and his failure to remain clear of mountainous terrain. The box canyon and proximity of mountains were related factors.The non-instrument rated commercial pilot was en route at 2000 feet msl on a night VFR flight when he reported an inadvertent encounter with instrument meteorological conditions. The helicopter (N124NH) subsequently crashed in a wooded area while in a steep descent. Continued VFR flight into IMC.The aircraft entered a steep dive from 16,000 ft. and crashed 10 minutes after taking off from Agadir. The pilot was blamed for disconnecting the autopilot and deliberately causing the crash and committing suicide. This was challenged by the Moroccan Pilot\\'s Union.While on approach, the aircraft went into a sudden nose dive from 6,000 ft. and crashed into a wooded ravine 6 miles northwest of Pittsburgh International Airport. The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the  primary slide. The most likely sequence of events that led up to the accident included the jamming of the PCU servo valve, the application of light left rudder followed by hard right rudder which caused the rudder to reverse in the opposite direction the pilot commanded it to go.  The application of hard right rudder was possibly initiated because the plane flew into the wake vortex of a B-727 which rolled the plane to the left.  Rudder hardover is normally corrected with the stick (ailerons) but because the plane was flying at the crossover speed of 190 knots with flaps 1, using the stick would not correct the situation. When the right rudder was applied the rudder went to its fullblown left position causing the plane to roll further left, stall and go into a dive. Some speculate if the pilot-in-command pushed forward on the yoke to gain some speed rather than pull back, the accident possibly could have been avoided. Blame was not placed on the crew because there was no mention of this type of recovery by the manufacturer nor was there any training for such an occurrence.The aircraft few into the side of a hill during heavy rain, high winds and severe turbulence.Just as the plane took off there was a pitch-up and stall resulting in the plane crashing into the water. The down elevator control cable failed at station 367 due to corrosion. The failure resulted from salt water induced corrosion. The aircraft had recently undergone a periodic inspection but the damage had apparently not been discovered.After circling for almost an hour and a half and aborting four landing attempts in adverse weather conditions, the aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed.The cargo plane lost control shortly after becoming airborne, began losing altitude and ditched 500 meters from the runway. The No. 4 prop pitch control system failed.After three landing attempts at Tura, the crew diverted to Vanavarva because of bad weather. The aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed on a river bank about 40 km from Vanavera.Crashed after experiencing engine failure.The cargo plane failed to gain altitude, overran the runway and crashed.

Overweight and improperly loaded.The aircraft was in a holding pattern and was descending to a newly assigned altitude of 8,000 feet when it experienced an uncommanded roll and excursion and crashed during a rapid descent. Icing. The design of the rubber de-icing boot was insufficient to deal with icing on the wings. Sudden and unexpected aileron hinge movement reversal, that occurred after a ridge of ice accreted beyond the deice boots while the airplane was in a holding pattern during which it intermittently encountered supercooled cloud and drizzle/rain drops, the size and water content of which exceeded those described in the icing certificication envelope. The airplane was susceptible to this loss of control and the crew was unable to recover. Contributing factor was the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation\\'s inadequate oversight of the ATR42 and ATR 72, and its failure to take the necessary corrective action to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions and failure to provide the FAA with timely airworthiness information developed from previous ATR incidents and accidents in icing conditions.Crashed into the sea off of Cozumel while en route in poor weather condtions.  Fuel exhaustion.The cargo plane crashed into a mountain a 4,000 ft.The pilot delayed landing to avoid a pedestrian on the runway, overran the runway and crashed into Saposoa River breaking up.While en route, the cargo plane made an uncontrolled descent and crashed.

Two aboard the Cessna were killed, none were killed aboard the DC-9.Shot down by UNITA rebel forces.An explosive device detonated at FL 300 under a seat in the passenger cabin blowing a two square foot hole in the cabin floor and killing one passenger in seat 26K. The bomb was placed on the plane by Ramzi Yousef, an Al-Qaeda terrorist, on the flight from Manila to Cebu. The explosion occurred on the second journey of the flight from Cebu to Tokyo. The plane made a safe emergency landing at Okinawa in spite of damage to the flight controls.The aircraft crashed 4 miles SW of runway 5L while on an ILS approach. The captain associated the illumination of the left engine ignition light with an engine failure, suspected an engine flame out and decided to execute a missed approach. This eventually led to a stall and the plane crashed 4 miles SW of the runway threshold. The captain\\'s improper assumption that an engine had failed. The captain\\'s subsequent failure to follow approved procedures for engine failure, single-engine approach, go-around, and stall recovery. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the failure of American Eagle management to identify, document, monitor and remedy deficiencies in pilot performance and training.The cargo plane lifted off the runway, stalled and hit tail first back on the runway breaking apart.The cargo plane hit trees and crashed short of the runway while attempting to land.The chartered flight struck a cliff at 6,400 ft. during a flight from a copper and gold mine.After a go-around the plane struck a transmission tower and crashed.

The accident occurred in daylight, in poor weather.While descending from FL 190, ground witnesses saw fire and sparks aboard the plane before it crashed and exploded. One nine-year-old girl survived. Her mother threw her out of the plane and she landed in some soft-water lilies. Possible electrical fire. Possible faulty altimeter.Took off and crashed into power lines in rain and fog. Continued VFR flight into IMC.The  captain decided to aborted the take-off. However, the aircraft was never brought to a stop and it continued  on overrunning the runway and crashing down a steep slope. Failure of the crew to follow the correct procedure to continue with the rejection of the take-off once that action had been initiated. Lack of crew coordination, insufficient emphasis on emergency training, inadequate enforcement of the requirements of the operations manual and a lack of supervision during loading preparation.The plane flew into a flock of birds that were injested into the left engine.  The pilot soon after reported an engine fire and that he was returning to the airport.  However, control of the plane was lost and the aircraft crashed.While taking off the aircraft veered to the right and clipped some trees 2,000 ft. past the runway. Overloaded and possible fuel contamination.On a positioning flight the crew aborted its first takeoff. On the second takeoff the tail struck the ground and crashed back to the ground. The loss of directional control by the pilot in command during the takeoff roll, and his decision to continue the takeoff and initiate a rotation below the computed rotation airspeed, resulting in a premature lift-off, further loss of control and collision with the terrain. The flight crew\\'s lack of understanding of the three-engine takeoff procedures, and their decision to modify those procedures. The failure of the company to ensure that the flight crew had adequate experience, training, and rest to conduct the nonroutine flight. Contributing to the accident was the inadequacy of Federal Aviation Administration oversight of Air Transport International and Federal Aviation Administration flight and duty time regulations that permitted a substantially reduced flight crew rest period when conducting a nonrevenue ferry flight under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.The cargo plane flew into high ground while on approach in poor weather conditons. Controllled flight into terrain.Shortly after takeoff in poor visibility and heavy snow, with autothrottles engaged, climb thrust was selected. The right engine throttle jammed and remained at takeoff thrust, while the left engine throttle slowly reduced to idle. The increasing thrust asymmetry resulted in an increasing left bank angle, which eventually reached about 170 degrees. The airplane lost altitude and impacted the ground. Lack of crew response to an extreme nose-down attitude. The investigation concluded that the captain was incapacitated. Just before impact the first officer expressed his concern about the situation of either the captain\\'s incapacitation or the aircraft\\'s attitude and attempted a recovery.The aircraft experienced a micoburst while attempting to land at Lagos landing hard on the nosegear. Full power was applied for a go-around but the aircraft veered off the runway and collided with another aircraft.While returning from Anuradhapura and descending through 3,000 ft the aircraft was shot down with a SAM missile by Tamil separatists.The SA-227 collided with the Piper PA-31-350 that was taking off while approaching Sioux Lookout. Neither flight crew saw the other aircraft in time to avoid the collision. The Piper crashed into a  wooded area and the Swearing into Lake Seul. Contributing to the occurrence were the inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept which preclude the effective separation of aircraft with high closure rates, the fact that neither crew was directly alerted to the presence of the other aircraft by the Flight Service specialist or by onboard electronic equipment and an apparent lack of pilot understanding of how to optimize avoidance maneuvering.Crashed into Cerro Sincholagua mountain at 16,000 ft.  during an approach to Quito. Pilot fatigue may have been a factor.Crashed into a mountain during approach in poor weather.An engine caught fire shortly after takeoff and the aircraft was not able to make an emergency landing and crashed.The crew had serious problems maintaining their heading after both artificial horizons failed shortly after takeoff. The crew had difficulty controlling the aircraft in turbulent conditions and the plane went into a spiral dive and crashed into a field. One or possibly both of the aircraft\\'s artificial horizons malfunctioned and in the absence of a standby horizon, for which there was no airworthiness requirement, there was no single instrument available for assured attitude reference or simple means of determining which flight instruments had failed. The pilot became spatially disoriented and was unable to maintain control.Ditched in the sea just offshore, after losing an engine on approach. The pilot was not rated for that aircraft type and had very little experience.As the plane approached  Runway 25,  the right main landing gear did not extend. While the captain continued the descent the co-pilot carried out the landing gear alternate extension checklist. The plane descended below the minimum safe step-down altitudes for the approach and struck the top of a ridge line. The captain did not ensure the aircraft intercepted and maintained the approach profile during the non-precision instrument approach. The captain\\'s  unwise decision to get the landing gear lowered without discontinuing the instrument approach. The captain\\'s distraction from the primary task of flying the aircraft safely during the first officer\\'s attempt  to correct a landing gear malfunction.Flying VOR the plane ran into poor weather and the pilot decided to return however crashed into trees while attempting to land.Crashed in poor weather condtions.The aircraft, carrying members of a local soccer club crashed 10 miles short of it\\'s destination.

Chichontepec volcano at 5,900 ft. at night during heavy rain and thunderstorms. Possible damage to the aircraft\\'s DME due to lightning. Confusion between the pilot and ATC due to bad weather and a diversion. The Ground Proximity Warning System had sounded and power was applied but too late.Crashed into Mt. Komawa at 9,200 ft. in poor weather. Found 8/14/95.Crashed into Nevado de Huila at an elevation of 14,500 feet.Shortly after taking off from Atlanta on a flight to Gulfport, the aircraft experienced propeller separation in the left engine while climbing through FL 180. The aircraft hit trees, crashed into a field and burned while trying to make an emergency landing at West Georgia Regional Airport. The in-flight fatigue fracture and separation of a propeller blade resulting in distortion of the left engine nacelle, causing excessive drag, loss of wing lift, and reduced directional control of the airplane. The fracture was caused by a fatigue crack from multiple corrosion pits that were not discovered by Hamilton Standard because of inadequate and ineffective corporate inspection and repair techniques, training, documentation and communication. Two died of their injuries after the accident.While en route the cargo plane flew into a 4,800 ft. mountain. The pilot\\'s continued VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions. The weather was a factor.During a low flying turn manuve, at an air show, the pilot caused the plane to stall and crash into the water. The captain made an error in judgement in modifying one of the display manoeuvres to the extent that he stalled the aircraft at a height and attitude from which recovery was impossible.After climbing to 18,400\\' msl, the pilot reported a turbocharger problem & reversed course. He said he \\'may lose the left engine\\' & that he was unable to maintain altitude. He diverted to an alternate airport. During a right turn onto final approach, the airplane was observed to cross (overshoot) the extended centerline of the runway. It continued in a right turn back toward the centerline, and then entered a left turn to intercept the inbound course. The turn steepened, and then the airplane entered a spin & crashed 1/2 mile short of the runway. Failure of the pilot to maintain adequate airspeed, while maneuvering on approach, which resulted in an inadvertent stall/spin and uncontrolled collision with terrain. Factors relating to the accident were: the pilot allowed the aircraft weight and balance limitations to be exceeded; the pilot\\'s lack of recurrent training in the make and model of airplane; inadequate maintenance/inspection of the engine exhaust systems; a warped and leaking exhaust system flange on the left engine, which resulted in a loss of power in that engine; and the pilot\\'s improper use of the flaps.Crashed short of the runway in rain, fog and reduced visibility after diverting from another airport and two landing attempts.Crashed after running out of fuel.The pilot reported an instrument problem after taking off from Ratmalana Airport and was returning for an emergency landing when the plane fell from 8,000 feet and crashed into the sea.Following a visual approach, the aircraft landed long and fast and overran the end of the runway into a shanty town while attempting a go-around.The plane crashed into mountains after a premature descent.The aircraft suffered multiple bird strikes in the No. 1 and 2 engines just after taking off when it flew into a flock of 100 or more Canada Geese. The crew initiated a slow climb and began to dump fuel. The aircraft attained a maximum altitude of 250 ft. before it started to descend. The plane impacted a hilly wooded area less than a mile from the runway, broke up, exploded and burned.  Ingestion of Canada geese into the Nos.1 and 2 engines. Lack of adequate procedures to reduce bird hazards. The crew was not warned about observations of birds in the area by the ATC.Crashed through the ice while attempting to land and sank in shallow water. The weather conditions were below minima and the helicopter exceeded its maximum takeoff weight.While on an intercept heading for the final approach and in straight-and-level flight, the aircraft crashed into the side of a 1,047 ft, mountain in heavy fog. The pilot progressively lost situational awareness while attempting to navigate in conditions of low visibility or in cloud and was unaware of the rapidly rising terrain in his flight path.Thirty minutes into the flight the aircraft was not able to maintain altitude after oil pressure was lost in the No. 1 engine. Crashed into trees.The helicopter crashed into mountains at Barskoon Pass while en route.The aircraft crashed into a 8,000 ft. mountain  in the Sierra Grande range while climbing en route from Comodoro Rivadavia to Cordoba in heavy rain and strong turbulence. The passengers included military personnel and their dependents.The aircraft touched down halfway down the runway, veered off the runway where dry grass caught fire under the aircraft and eventually spread destroying the aircraft.Crashed into the Indian Ocean while attempting to land at Palay Air Force Base. Most likely shot down by Tamil rebels.Crashed at sea disappearing while en route. Debris found near Labuan Island.  Strong winds and thunderstorms were in the area at the time.While attempting to land the cargo plane struck light posts and crashed into a field.The plane went into a dive and crashed 6 km short of the runway into a swamp during a second attempt at landing. Loss of power in the No. 1 engine.The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff while attempting to make an emergency landing after the pilot reported problems with the left engine. Vibration caused nuts to work loose from the engine turbine which resulted in engine failure. No fault was found with the right engine and it is believed that it may have been inadvertently shut down by the crew.The aircraft crashed into mountainous terrain while en route. Crew error. Fuel-feed selected from wing tanks on one side only, causing an imbalance and banking to the right. The autopilot was able to counteract the imbalance for approximately 35 minutes into the flight.The plane crashed and burned shortly after takeoff after reaching a height of 500 ft. Combination of overloading and icing.The plane, chartered by the UNITA rebel movement, stalled and crashed shortly after takeoff from Jamba. Overloaded by 40 passengers. One report stated baggage shifted to the rear of the plane.While on a flight from Miami, FL to Cali, Columbia the aircraft crashed into Mt. El Deluvio 38 miles north of Cali while attempting to land. On approach, the crew was requested to report over Tulua VOR which they already passed. This confused them and they decided to go direct to Rozo beacon. Entering the abbreviation \"R\", incorrectly steered the plane towards Bogota. More than a minute into the  turn the crew steered manually toward Cali, but this now took them into the path of a mountain. Crew error.

The plane departed towards a nearby thunderstorm in deteriorating weather. Witnesses describe the plane\\'s climb rate and speed as slow and they observed the aircraft enter a roll consistent with a stall. The plane\\'s gross weight was 84 pounds over the maximum limit. Pilot\\'s improper decision to take off into deteriorating weather conditions when the airplane was overweight resulting in stall caused by failure to maintain airspeed.After a number of failed landing attempts during a sandstorm, the aircraft made a forced landing in a local suburb crashing into a building.On a positioning flight the aircraft flew into a mountain.Crashed into high ground while attempting to land at a mine airstrip in turbulence and stong gusty winds.The aircraft crashed 18 miles NW of Miami airport  in a remote part of the Everglades. Shortly after taking off, after the crew reported fire and smoke in the cabin and cockpit. The in-flight fire was caused by activation of one or more oxygen generators in the forward cargo hold. The generators were outdated, improperly labeled, lacked safety caps and were prohibited from being transported on a passenger flight. The loss of control resulted either from flight control failure or incapacitation of the crew due to extreme heat and smoke.  Candi Kubeck was the first American female commercial airline captain to be killed in a crash. San Diego Chargers running back Rodney Culver, 26, and his wife were among the passengers killed as was singer, songwriter Walter Hyatt, 46.Crashed into a ridge line shrouded in clouds while en route.Crashed during a second attempt at landingThe training flight crashed into a field during touch-and-go landings.The two helicopters collided in mid-air while flying in formation. The pilots may have possibly been  stressed fatigued and inadequately prepared and were flying too low to see the target.The aircraft overran the runway after an aborted takeoff. The fuel line in the No.3 engine was sheared and caught fire after the fanblade of the first stage HP turbine separated. During the slide the No. 1 engine and landing gear were lost ane the plane came to rest in a ditch. Three passengers were trapped in the wreckage and overcome by toxic fumes after a fire started. Pilot error. Improper procedures used by the captain after engine failure.The aircraft crashed into a mountain after deviating off course during a landing attempt.Fan disk separation in the left engine.

Aboard were members of a  Dutch Army Band returning from Italy.Crashed 150 ft. short of the runway.While on a flight from New York to Paris, France, the aircraft exploded at  FL 130, broke up and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island, N.Y. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was an explosion of the center wing fuel tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the center wing tank that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.  To say that numerous government agencies acted strangely and suspiciously would be an understatement.  A great deal of evidence was either suppressed or ignored. Rumors persist that the plane was brought down by a missile, either by the Navy conducting exercises in the area or by terrorists.Soon after takeoff, the No. 3 engine caught fire in the cargo plane. The pilot tried to return to the airport for an emergency landing but the right wing seperated and the plane crashed. Fatigue failure of the master connecting rod, which originated from corrosion pitting, subsequently compromised the engine crankcase, and resulted in a fire; and failure of the flight crew to follow emergency procedures by pulling the fire handle before feathering the propeller, which diminished the effectiveness of the fire suppression system.A straight-in visual approach to Mergui was being attempted when the aircraft entered a squall line of heavy rain. The aircraft then started to lose height quickly, undershot the runway by 800ft. And crashed into a ravine.After touching down, the cargo plane bounced twice and continued to the end of the runway, became airborne but crashed terrain. For unknown reasons, a decision was made to overshoot even though insufficient runway remained for acceleration, take-off, and climb. Likely contributing directly to the decision to overshoot was the difficulty in controlling the aircraft on touchdown.After taking off the  No. 2 engine of the cargo plane caught on fire. The pilot tried to land the plane in a river bed. The number 2 engine separated from the aircraft as a result of an intense fire in the wing. The loss of the engine rendered the aircraft uncontrollable, and the pilots were forced to land in the river.The plane struck a mountain. Failure of the crew to monitor the aircraft\\'s position and flight path relative to high terrain surrounding Jackson Hole Airport.While en route, flew into the side of a mountain. The pilot probably made a navigational error because of restricted visibility in fog and light drizzle and entered the wrong valley, and he delayed his decision to reverse course until he was unable to avoid the weather.After taking off from Belgrade, the plane experienced electrical problems and returned to the airport. After dumping fuel and circling for 3 hours, the plane crashed into a corn field 800m short of the runway.The aircraft crashed 7 nm short of the runway into Operafjellet Mountain at an altitude of 2,900 ft. while attempting to land in poor weather. The crew did not use the usual approach which includes a turn over the ocean, but rather took a route that led through a narrow valley. Inadequate planning, unsatisfactory crew resource management and monitoring, not discontinuing the approach when procedural uncertainties existed and limited knowledge of the operating language and the actual airspace. The passengers were mainly Russian coal miners headed for a Russian mine on one of the Norwegian islands.Shortly after takeoff from Texel, a connecting rod bearing in the No.1 engine failed. The prop was feathered.  Soon after, a part of the feathering mechanism failed and the prop started windmilling causing drag. The aircraft rapidly descended and crashed onto a mud-flat. The accident was initiated by a combined failure of the left engine and the left feathering system. The accident became inevitable when the flight crew allowed the speed to decrease below stall speed and lost control of the aircraft at an altitude from which recovery was not possible.The aircraft crashed into the ocean 28 minutes after taking off from Lima, Peru. Pieces of adhesive tape were found covering the static ports, placed there by personnel during aircraft maintenance and cleaning, causing the malfunction of the airspeed indicators and altimeters. The crew was not able to correctly determine their altitude and airspeed and with no ground reference over water and at night, crashed into the sea. An employee did not remove the adhesive tape from the static ports, nor was it detected by any number of people, including the captain, during the preflight inspection. A maintenance worker was tried and convicted of negligent homicide for failing to remove the adhesive tape and received 2 years in jail.Crashed on take off.While attempting to land the landing lights malfunctioned causing the cargo plane to veer off the runway and crash into a house.The cargo plane struck trees and a house while making a second attempt to land.

The aircraft went into a roll and lost control after taking evasive action to avoid another aircraft. The plane was flying almost at the speed of sound when it crashed and disintegrated. ATC error. The controller thought he had cleared to aircraft to FL100 but the aircraft was still flying at FL240.The pilot reported that an engine failed just as he started to descend for a landing. He later informed ATC he could not feather the propeller. The  aircraft subsequently crashed and burned in a field.  The accident was due to inappropriate management of the flight following jamming of the propeller in an intermediate position after the right engine crankshaft ruptured. The inappropriate management was due to the pilotâ\\x80\\x99s relative lack of experience on this aircraft type, his false notions about the aircraftâ\\x80\\x99s performance and about the existence of a flight level to maintain level flight with an unfeathered propeller and an heavy aircraft and a series of misjudged strategies to attempt to continue the flight then to land at Limoges when the aircraftâ\\x80\\x99s altitude no longer made this possible.Midair collision 17 km W of New Delhi.  The Saudi 747 had just taken off from New Delhi airport ascending to 14,000 feet while the Il-76 was descending. Three hundred twelve aboard the B-747 and thirty-seven aboard the Il-76 were killed. The Il-76 descended below its assigned altitude. The death toll was reduced from 351 to 349 after Kazakstan Airlines reported 37 aboard rather than 39. Neither aircraft was equipped with an Airborne Collision Avoidance System. The 747 had taken off from Delhi and had been cleared to climb to FL140.  Meanwhile, the IL76, which was inbound to Delhi on the same airway, had been cleared to descend to FL150. However, due to a misunderstanding, the pilot and most of the cockpit crew of the IL76 believed the flight had been cleared to continue down to FL140. The Indian accident report attributed the failure of most of the IL76 crew to correctly understand the situation due to their lack of a working knowledge of English. Also contributing to the crew\\'s decision to continue the descent below their clearance limit were poor cockpit resource management, a lack of leadership by the captain, a lack of co-ordination between the crew and a general casual attitude to the conduct of the flight.Lost altitude and crashed while en route in poor weather. Stall of the left wing due to icing.While landing on Runway 13 at Baldwin Field, the United Express collided with the King Air which was taking off on Runway 4. The collision took place where the two runways intersect. Both planes caught fire and rescuers were unable to open the door to the Beech 1900-C because of impact damage. All twelve aboard the United Express and the two pilots aboard the King Air were killed. King Air pilots\\' failure to use proper communications and \"see-and-avoid\" procedures at an uncontrolled airport. Involvement of a third aircraft that transmitted unnecessary and inappropriate messages.Crashed 60 miles west of Cape Mendocino in the Pacific Ocean. The crew reported losing an engine, followed by complete electrical failure.The aircraft was hijacked shortly after taking off from Ethiopia by three drunken escaped prisoners. They demanded to be flown to Australia, but wouldn\\'t let the pilot stop to refuel. The plane eventually ran out of fuel and ditched 500 feet offshore of Le Galawa Beach on the island of Grand Comoros. When it was aparent the plane was out of fuel, the hijackers fought the pilot for control of the aircraft. In the last seconds aloft, the left wing tip struck the water and the plane crashed into the sea flipping at least once before breaking into several  parts. The water was shallow but many passengers had inflated their safety vests which prevented them from swimming out from under the cabin and they drowned.The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff. Overloaded.The aircraft crashed into a mountain 5 minutes after takeoff. The plane stalled while trying to clear a mountain.  Overloaded.After experiencing a No.2 engine fire and while attempting to return to the airport, the aircraft\\'s wing struck a building short of the runway.Shortly after takeoff  the crew reported they had the right engine on fire. They attempted to return for an emergency landing but the cargo plane crashed right wing low, cartwheeled and burst into flames short of the runway. A fire within the right engine compartment of undetermined cause and the pilot-in-command\\'s failure to maintain airspeed above the aircraft\\'s minimum control speed. A factor contributing to the accident was the dark night environmental conditionsCrashed 8km from the airfield after taking off in strong winds and heavy snow.The cargo plane crashed short of the runway while attempting to land.The cargo plane struck mountainous terrain after experiencing a stall during tests. The inappropriate control inputs applied by the flying pilot during a stall recovery attempt, the failure of the non-flying pilot-in-command to recognize, address and correct these inappropriate control inputs, and the failure of Airborne Express to establish a formal, functional evaluation flight program that included adequate program guidelines, requirements and pilot training for performance of these flights. Contributing to the cause of the accident were the inoperative stick shaker stall warning system and Airborne Express DC-8 flight training simulator\\'s inadequate fidelity in reproducing the airplane\\'s stall characteristics.The cargo plane was on a positioning flight when it struck rising terrain while making an approach to land. The captain\\'s failure to maintain situational awareness, which resulted in the airplane being outside the confines of the instrument approach; and the crew\\'s misinterpretation of a step-down fix passage, which resulted in an early descent into rising terrain. Factors included the captain\\'s misreading of the instrument approach procedure, the crew\\'s rushed and incomplete instrument approach briefing, their failure to use additional, available navigational aids, and their failure to account for the winds at altitude.Crashed while en route after the pilot reported an engine fire. Undetected cracks in the engine not detected during routine maintenance.Crashed onto a mountin in high winds and rain after being diverted from another airport.While on approach and attempting to land on runway 3R at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, in a snowstorm, the aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed into a field. The accident was caused by the FAA\\'s failure to establish adequate aircraft certification standards for flight in icing conditions.  Contributing to the accident were the flightcrew\\'s decision to operate in icing conditions near the lower margin of the operating airspeed envelope (with flaps retracted), and Comair\\'s failure to establish and adequately disseminate unambiguous minimum airspeed values for flap configurations and for flight in icing conditions. In addition, Embraer\\'s manual for the aircraft specified correctly that the deicing boots should be activated as soon as icing occured.  But the pilots were trained by Comair\\'s manual, which specified waiting until ice was about 1/2 inch thick.While en rote the plane experienced engine trouble. The crew decided to divert to Sparrevohn. While attempting to land the plane encountered strong turbulence from surrounding mountains. Although full power was applied to the good engine the plane crashed into terrain. Loss of the right engine propeller control oil, which led to an overspeed of the right engine and propeller, and necessitated a shut-down of the right engine; and failure of the pilot to maintain adequate altitude/distance from terrain during visual approach for a precautionary landing at an alternate airport. Factors relating to the accident were: fluctuation of the left engine power, premature lowering of the airplane flaps, and an encounter with adverse weather conditions (including high winds, severe turbulence, and white-out conditions) during the approach.After being in a holding pattern for over an hour the plane hit trees and a  power line and crashed 700m short of the runway. Failure to maintain the aircraft above the Minimum Descent Altitude while the aircraft was not positioned in the final landing phase.The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off fromTambacoumba after losing power in the left engine.

The first officer was killed.Flew into a mountain while on approach.Crashed short of the runway in dense fog while attempting to land a second time at Lucapa.The plane was carrying military personnel and their families and crashed 24 miles NE of Mashhad in the Binalud Heights. The pilot reported engine failure prior the crash.The aircraft lost altitude from FL 197 and crashed into a forest while en route from Stavropol, Russia to Trabzon, Turkey. Reports indicated that an in-flight  fire and an explosion led to the separation of the tail section prior to the crash. Superficial mechanical inspection of the aircraft which was carried out without the use of monitoring instruments and subsequent unjustified decision to extend the time between overhauls.  Inadequate monitoring to determine the state of structural elements and detect the presence of corrosion in hard-to-reach areas under the floor of the fuselage. Failure to carry out prescribed anti-corrosion measures on the aircraft structure during overhaul.While landing the aircraft overran the runway, hit a concrete drainage ditch, when through a fence and came to rest on a highway where it caught fire.On a positioning flight, while taking off the plane suffered engine failure, overran the runway and crashed into a vacant building.After making two approaches the pilot decided to head back to the departure airport. He flew north at an altitude beneath minimum radar coverage. The plane impacted the frozen Arctic Ocean in a right bank and at a 60 degree nose-down attitude. The pilot\\'s intentional VFR flight into instrument meteorological conditions and his failure to maintain altitude and clearance from terrain. A contributing factor was the weather conditions.The cargo plane became airborne but soon lost altitude and crashed to the ground and burst into flames.A stray bullet from training soldiers struck the landing plane, hitting an oxygen cylinder. A fire broke out and control of the plane was lost and it crashed.Crashed after an engine fire.During the final stage of a visual approach, one of the aircraft\\'s engines failed. The crew failed to correctly identify the problem and because of the flight regime, the propeller did not autofeather. The approach was continued, however, as the aircraft descended through about 2,000ft., power was applied at the start of a go-around. Control was lost and the aircraft crashed.The transport crashed into a mountain.The aircraft touched down hard, causing the nosegear to collapse. The pilot chose to to go-around. The aircraft climbed away but shortly after, the pilot declared an emergency and attempted to land on the runway in the opposite direction. The aircraft crashed on the runway, broke up and caught fire.The accident happened in poor weather with heavy rain associated with local thunderstorm activity.Crashed shortly after taking off. Fire in the cabin.The aircraft crashed while attemping to land. Windshear. Lack of windshear equipment at the airport.Shortly after taking off the cargo plane crashed into the ocean. The pilot lost control when he encountered severe weather conditions soon after taking off.An explosion caused explosive decompression and a six-foot hole in the side of the fuselage. One passenger was sucked out and killed.  A small bomb containing only 7 ounces of explosives was placed under a passenger seat.  It is reported that the police believed the bomb was planted as part of a failed suicide attempt by one of the passengers.The plane crashed into the ocean 4 miles off the coast shortly after takeoff.

Won Guam International Airport. The runway glide slope system was inoperative. In addition, the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning system (MSAW) was also not working due to a software problem. The captainâ\\x80\\x99s failure to adequately brief and execute the non-precision approach and the first officer\\'s and flight engineer\\'s failure to effectively monitor and cross-check the captainâ\\x80\\x99s execution of the approach. Contributing to these failures were the captain\\'s fatigue and Korean Air\\'s  inadequate flight crew training. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration\\'s (FAA) intentional inhibition of the MSAW at Guam and the agency\\'s failure to adequately manage the system.Immediately after taking off the plane went into a nose-high attitude, stalled and crashed to the ground. The probable cause of the accident, which resulted from the airplane being misloaded to produce a more aft center of gravity and a correspondingly incorrect stabilizer trim setting that precipitated an extreme pitch-up at rotation, was (1) the failure of Fine Air to exercise operational control over the cargo loading process and  (2) the failure of Aeromar to load the airplane as specified by Fine Air. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the FAA to adequately monitor Fine Airs operational control responsibilities for cargo loading and the failure of the FAA to ensure that known cargo-related deficiencies were corrected at Fine Air.The aircraft flew into a mountain and exploded in flames after a missed approach and while executing a go-around in rain and high winds. The pilot turned right instead of left when initiating the go-around.Collided with a Cessna 206 (OB-1450) and crashed 3 miles from the airfield. Six killed on the Pilatus and 6 on the CessnaThe plane was on a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh when it crashed while making an approach to Pochentong International Airport in heavy rain.

The Tupolev 154 aircraft was flying at the wrong cruise altitude which caused the midair collision. Twenty-four killed aboard the Tupolev and 9 aboard the C-141. Contributing factors included weak flight-following procedures of the Luanda ATC and  poor regional ground communications.The aircraft crashed into mountainous terrain 15 minutes before it was due to land at Medan on a flight from Jakarta. The aircraft crashed 20 miles from the airport. Combination of ATC errors in directing the plane in the wrong direction into mountainous terrain and the crew setting and using their instruments incorrectly. Contributing to the accident was impared visibility due to smoke from forest fires in the area.Collided with terrain at the 9,900 foot level on the Uncompahgre Plateau. The pilot\\'s failure to maintain sufficient airspeed for undetermined reasons while maneuvering the airplane near maximum gross weight and aft center of gravity in or near instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in a loss of control and entry into a stall/spin.The aircraft crashed  near Nuevo Berlin, a town on the banks of the Uruguay River, after changing its route to avoid heavy rain and hail. A crater 25 feet deep crater was created where the plane crashed into the earth.  Icing of the pitot tubes. The pitot tubes froze after the aircraft passed through 49,000 ft. giving false speed readings leading to loss of control of the aircraft.Crashed in poor weather after a go-around.The aircraft had just finished performing 3 touch-and-go landings at Monterey Peninsula Airport. Shortly after taking off a fourth time, witnesses heard the engine make popping noises, bank to the right, pitch up, and go into a steep dive from about a  500 foot altitude and crash into the sea about 150 yards offshore. Singer John Denver, 53, who was piloting the plane, was killed. Denver, an experienced pilot with over 2,800 flying hours, had only a little over an hour in the experimental plane. The accident was caused by the inadvertent application of right rudder by the pilot as he attempted to manipulate the fuel selector handle. The unmarked fuel selector handle in this aircraft was located in a hard to reach area behind the pilot\\'s left shoulder, instead of between his legs. This required removing his harness and reaching behind. While turning around, he inadvertently pressed down on the plane\\'s right rudder pedal causing the aircraft to roll and go into a dive.  Contributing factors were, Denver took off with too little fuel in one tank which led to the necessity of switching to his backup tank. Also it was difficult to determine how much fuel was in the tanks due to the unmarked fuel quantity sight gauge.A few minutes after takeoff a distress call was received from the aircraft after which it ditched into the sea 200 yards offshore. The pilot\\'s disregard for lateral fuel loading limits, his improper removal of frost prior to takeoff, and the resulting inadvertent stall/spin. Factors involved in this accident were the improper asymmetrical fuel loading which reduced lateral aircraft control, the self-induced pressure to takeoff on time by the pilot, and inadequate surveillance of the company operations by company management.The military aircraft, bound for Vladivostok, crashed into a residential neighborhood twenty seconds after taking off. All four engines failed after the computer system began shutting them down shortly after takeoff.  Design flaw which led to uncoordinated operation of the high-pressure compressors.Crashed during the second approach right of the approach path. While the aircraft was being manoeuvred at a very low level in marginal weather, it descended after an abrupt turn and flew, in controlled flight, into the terrain. Crew procedural error. The aircraft was 1,000 pounds heavier than the maximum allowable weight.  The GPS installed in aircraft was not approved as a primary navigational aid.During take off, shortly after the landing gear was retracted, one of the aircraft\\'s engines lost power and the propeller autofeathered. The aircraft rolled to the right, struck trees and crashed inverted.The aircraft crashed and burned while making an attempt to land. A number of errors by the crew resulted in the acccident. Not maintaining the height indicated during the last contact with the ATC. Not following instructions from the ATC. Crew fatigue and turbulence in the area contributed to the accident.The aircraft crashed into Mt. Olympus while approaching Salonica, during a second attempt to land. The plane was holding at 3,300 feet due to heavy traffic. Tower tapes indicate that after the missed approach, the crew reported they were heading north when they actually were heading west. An investigation revealed the crew had poor training, flew too low, didn\\'t know how to use the radar equipment and failed to declare an emergency after they missed the landing strip. A second crash occurred when a C-130 transport plane on its way to pick up troops to assist in the search, crashed into Pastra Mountain.The plane disappeared off radar screens and shortly after, crashed into the Musi River. The plane, almost brand-new, cruising in good weather and with an experienced crew, suddenly left normal flight from 35,000 feet and crashed at a high rate of speed into the Sumatran jungle. The right wing and parts of the rudder separated from the aircraft before it crashed. The Indonesian National Transportation Committee found that there was insufficient evidence to find a cause for the accident. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board strongly disagreed and stated the jet\\'s cockpit voice recorder was intentionally disconnected and its flight controls placed in a nose-down position most likely by the captain. While the U.S. NTSB stopped short of using the term suicide, its dissenting report made it clear it believed the crash was the result of actions by the captain. In July 2004 a California jury found the manufacturer of the PCU valve that controls rudder responsible for the accident after the valve was located and showed defects which may have led to a rudder hardover.Crashed in the Pastra mountains while searching for the wreckage of an Aerosweet Yak-42 that was missing.Went missing while en route. May have been shot down.Two hours into the flight, at FL 310, the plane received reports of severe clear air turbulence in the area and the seat belt sign was turned on. Moments later, the aircraft suddenly dropped around one hundred feet seriously injuring many passengers and causing damage to the aircraft. The plane landed safely back at Tokyo, but  one passenger died of her injuries.Crashed into dense jungle, 4 miles short of its destination in heavy fog.Fog and low visibility forced the plane to divert to divert to Brno. After a missed approach the aircraft crashed 3.5 km short of the runway threshold and was destroyed.The aircraft  was on a flight from Kandahar to Herat but was forced to return to Kandahar because of poor weather when it crashed into a mountain 70 miles north of Quetta in Khojak Pass. The last message from the pilot was \"we are running low on fuel.\" Crashed due to fuel starvation.The aircraft crashed on takeoff after the No. 2 engine failed and caused the aircraft to swerve off the runway and crash into an embankment and burst into flames.Flight 387 originated in Manila on a flight to Tacloban and Cagayan de Oro. The aircraft crashed while on approach to Cagay de Oro into a remote mountainous area.  Wreckage was found near the town of Pagalungan, NE of Cagay de Oro. The last radio message from the pilot was \"leveling off at 5,000 feet sir.\"  The cockpit voice recorder revealed that the GPWS warned of terrain a dozen times just before impact. The crew apparently got lost in a cloud, never realizing they were headed into a mountain. Pilot error, inadequate training standards and deficient equipment.The aircraft struck and severed the cable to a gondola causing it to fall 300 ft. to the ground and killing 20 on board. The plane landed safely. Negligence by the crew in flying above the speed limit and well below the prescribed minimum altitude in the area.Shortly after taking off the plane lost power in the No. 3 engine followed by the No. 4 engine.

The plane, designed to carry a maximum of 19 passengers, was carring 26. Overloaded.Flight 420 took off from Montreal\\'s Dorval Airport on a flight to Peterborough  About 12 minutes after take off, at an altitude of 12,500 feet, the crew advised ATC that they had a hydraulic problem and requested clearance to return to Dorval. The crew then advised ATC that the left engine had been shut down because it was on fire. The crew decided to proceed to Mirabel International Airport. Then crew then advised ATC that the engine fire was out. On final for Runway 24, the crew advised ATC that the left engine was again on fire. The landing gear was extended on short final, and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards. The fuselage inverted, struck the runway and slid 2,500 feet and came to rest on the left side of the runway.  PC: The crew did not realize that the pull to the left and the extended take-off run were due to the left brakes\\' dragging, which led to overheating of the brake components. The dragging caused overheating and leakage, probably at one of the piston seals that retain the brake hydraulic fluid. When hydraulic fluid leaked onto the hot brake components, the fluid caught fire and initiated an intense fire in the left nacelle, leading to failure of the main hydraulic system. When the L WING OVHT light went out, the overheating problem appeared corrected; however, the fire continued to burn. The crew never realized that all of the problems were associated with a fire in the wheel well, and they did not realize how serious the situation was. The left wing was weakened by the wing/engine fire and failed, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable.The helicopter impacted a mountain on a sightseeing trip. The pilot\\'s decision to continue VFR flight into deteriorating weather conditions consisting of lowering ceilings and visibility in mountainous terrain, which resulted in the inadvertent entry into instrument meteorological conditions and a collision with a mountainside.

The Beechcraft was on a flight from Lyon to Lorient, approaching Lorient, when it requested permission to fly over the ocean liner Norway. While circling the Norway, it collided with the Cessna. One killed aboard the Cessna, 14 aboard the Beechcraft.  The pilots of the Beechcraft decided to deviate from their course in order to give passengers a view of the ocean liner Le France. This is unusual but not forbidden. They also descended to 2,000 feet, below the level of radar detection. Both planes approached each other within blind spots. Failure of both pilots to \"see and avoid\" each other under VFR conditions.Shortly after taking off the plane pitched up, stalled and crashed to the ground. The  pitch-up was caused by an uncommanded downward movement of the horizontal stabilizer. This was due to a partial detachment of the actuator forward bearing support fitting due to the non-installation of required hi-lok fasteners.The pilot made three low passes over the water in an attempt to land at Kincolith. On the fourth approach, the aircraft touched down, apparently in a controlled manner, and skipped on the water surface. The floats then dug into the water followed by the right wing, which was severed from the fuselage on water impact. The aircraft quickly overturned and came to rest inverted with only the bottom of the floats visible. All five occupants drowned. On touchdown, the floats struck the water and caused a flying attitude that the pilot could not control before the right wing dug in and the aircraft overturned. Contributing to the accident were conflicting wind and water conditions at the time of the occurrence.Blew a tire while landing causing the plane to to run off the runway and crash.While en route, the aircraft experienced double engine failure. The plane ditched into Foveaux Strait. Five passengers were rescued, but four passengers and the pilot did not have lifejackets and did not survive.

The accident flight was not conducted in accordance with the night obstacle clearance requirements of Canadian Aviation Regulation. The Kelowna Flightcraft company operations manual did not reflect the restrictive conditions imposed on night visual flight rules (VFR) flight by CAR 705.32. Such information might have prevented the accident by ensuring the crew\\'s awareness of those night obstacle clearance standards.After initiating a go-around, the aircraft veered left and commenced a shallow climb before suddenly rolling right and descending steeply onto a tidal flat. The pilot initiated a go-around from final approach because of a vehicle on the airstrip. The left propeller showed little evidence of rotation damage. The reason for a possible loss of left engine power could not be determined. For reasons that could not be established, the pilot lost control of the aircraft at a low height.The plane, on a relief mission to Bluefields was waved off from landing because of a blocked runway.

The crash site was 1.5 miles from the airport.Crashed into Huirotico Hill. Wreckage found 4 days later.On approach, the crew of the cargo plane descended to MDA and initiated a go-around after the runway was not seen.  On the second approach the captain descended below MDA and  the aircraft struck the ground in controlled flight 2 nm short of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed. The captain decided to descend below the minimum descent altitude without the required visual references. After descending below MDA, both pilots were preoccupied with acquiring and maintaining visual contact with the ground and did not adequately monitor the flight instruments; thus, the aircraft flew into the ice.The pilot-in-command lost control during touch-and-go landing and crashed.The aircraft departed Adana to pick up Turkish pilgrims. The plane crashed 9 minutes after taking off in poor weather conditions. Severe weather probably contributed to the cause of the accident. Pitot anti-icing system was probably not activated because of missed checklist items. The crew failed to recognize the cause of erratic airspeed indications and failed to use other cockpit indications for control and recovery of the aircraft.The aircraft crashed into La Caida Hill in fog, 10 minutes from its destination. The aircraft was off course.Shortly after taking off  and after getting into a disagreement with the first officer about the planes altitude, the captain pushed down on the control column and the plane entered a rapid descent.

Kennedy Jr., 38, crashed into the sea approximately 34 miles west of Martha\\'s Vineyard while en route from Fairfield, New Jersey to Martha\\'s Vineyard, Massachusetts. Killed along with Kennedy were his wife Carolyn and her sister Lauren Bessette. Kennedy\\'s failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation. Contributing factors in the accident were haze, and the dark night.Two minutes after taking off from Haneda Airport, a man carrying a knife forced a flight attendant to take him in the cockpit of the plane.  A fan of computer flight-simulation games, he stated he just wanted to fly a real plane.  After forcing the co-pilot out of the cockpit he ordered the captain to fly to a U.S. Air Force base in western Tokyo. When he refused, he stabbed the captain and seized the controls. After a sudden drop in altitude, the co-pilot and an off duty crew member entered the cockpit and overpowered the hijacker.  A one point the plane plunged to within 984 feet of the ground. The plane ultimately  landed safely but the captain died of his injuries.The plane crashed into Patascoy mountain at 7,000 ft. on a reconnaissance flight over drug producing areas.The plane crashed into a mountainside at an altitude of about 1,800 feet about 15 minutes after taking off from Nausori Airport bound for Nadi International Airport. The plane was observed by witnesses flying low prior to the crash. The wreckage indicated the aircraft descended until the right wing hit a line of trees at the 1,300 ft. elevation. It was determined the captain had insufficient sleep prior to the flight and had consumed an  excessive amount  antihistamine both of which may have influenced his performance. Published operational standards by Air Fiji, inadequate for the particular type of aircraft.The aircraft, which was chartered from the Cape Verde Coast Guard, crashed into a cliff near Ponta do Sol airfield in the Cape Verde Islands in fog and rain. The plane was returning to the island of Sao Vicente where it originally departed  due to poor weather conditions over the destination city. The pilot possibly lost visibility due to the fog and rain and crashed into a cliff in Santo Antao.While making a landing in strong winds and rain, the pilot-in-command disconnected the autopilot but left the autothrottle engaged. The aircraft, with a weight close to the maximum landing weight permitted, stabilized slightly low on the glideslope. An attempt was made to flare but the aircraft landed hard on its right landing gear and the No.3 engine touched the runway. The right main landing gear and right wing separated. The MD-11 then inverted and skidded off the runway in flames. Probable Cause: The commander\\'s unability to arrest the high rate of descent existing at 50 ft. RA. Contributory Causes:  The commander\\'s failure to appreciate the combination of a reducing airspeed, increasing rate of descent, and with the thrust decreasing to flight idle. The commander\\'s failure to apply power to counteract the high rate of descent prior to touchdown. Probable variations in wind direction and speed below 50 ft RA may have resulted in a momentary loss of headwind component and, in combination with the early retardation of the thrust levers, and at a weight only just below the maximum landing weight, led to a 20 kt loss in indicated airspeed just prior to touchdown. A possible contributory cause may have been a reduction in peripheral vision as the aircraft entered the area of the landing flare, resulting in the commander not appreciating the high rate of descent prior to touchdown.A fire in the front portion of the cabin, in the overhead luggage compartment, caused thick black smoke to accumulate in the cabin.  Accidental ignition of gas taken aboard in 2 bleach and softner bottles, stored in a overhead locker.The aircraft struck power lines 2,000m past the end of the runway after a second attempted go-around.While attempting to take off from Jorge Newberry airport, the crew aborted takeoff, overran the runway, skidded across a service road and crashed into several cars and into a golf course, bursting into flames.  The crew forgot to extend the wing flaps to initiate take-off, and ignored the alarm that advised them of the error in configuration for take-off. The pilots did not maintain a sterile cockpit, sharing a cigarette and socializing with a flight attendant. While on approach to Tribhuvan International Airport, the aircraft struck a telecommunication tower with its left wing and crashed onto slopes of a wooded area, 6 miles southwest of the airport.The aircraft touched down hard, bounced, and made a second heavier touchdown causing substantial damage to the nosewheel and its supports. The Boeing 757 left the runway at high speed, approximately 1,000m from the second touchdown point. It then ran 343m across flat grassland beside the runway, before going diagonally over a substantial earth mound adjacent to the airport boundary, becoming semi airborne as a result. Beyond the mound it hit a number of medium sized trees and the right engine struck the boundary fence. The aircraft then passed through the fence, re-landed in a field and both main landing gears collapsed. It finally stopped after a slide across the field. One passenger, who had been admitted to hospital with apparently minor injuries and discharged the following day, died five days later from unsuspected internal injuries.Experienced pitch oscillations during descent and crashed while landing.

The plane\\'s altitude varied between 22,000 and 51,000 feet during the flight. A possible pressurization failure, as indicated by frosted windows, observed by fighter jet pilots trailing the plane, may have killed all aboard. Pro golfer, Payne Stewart, 42, killed. Incapacitation of the flight crewmembers as a result of their failure to receive supplemental oxygen following a loss of cabin pressurization, for undetermined reasons. Possible contributing factor: The emergency checklist was written in such a way that it did not direct the crew first don their face masks.The plane took off from JFK at 1:19 a.m. bound for Cairo, Egypt. Thirty-three minutes later, after attaining an altitude of 33,000 feet, it was observed on radar in an extremely rapid descent. The aircraft was observed in a 66 degree dive at 483 knots. The descent continued to 16,700 feet after which the aircraft climbed to 24,000 ft.   After that, the plane began a second dive and broke up at around 10,000 ft. crashing into the Atlantic Ocean, 60 miles southeast of Nantucket Island.  The aircraft was named Thutmosis III. The accident was caused by the relief first officer\\'s flight control inputs which caused the airplane\\'s departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean. The reason for the first officer\\'s actions were not determined by the NTSB. One could conclude the actions were deliberate in an attempt to commit suicide.The plane was on a flight from Tujuana to Mexico City, with stops at Guadalajara and Uruapan. After reaching Uruapan, seventy-eight passengers deplaned.One minute after taking off from Uruapan, the crew declared an emergency without saying what was wrong. A few minutes later the plane went into a steep dive and crashed in a mountainous area 3.3 miles south of the airport. Some witnesses stated the plane was on fire before it hit the ground. TAESA\\'s operation license was suspended due to the incident, which prompted inquiries regarding the airline\\'s safety and maintenance procedures.The plane was on a flight from Rome, Italy to Pristina, Kosovo with a stop at Tirana, Albania. The plane disappeared from radar and crashed about 10 miles north of Pristina into a hill in poor weather. The plane was a U.N. charter flight on a routine humanitarian mission to distribute food. Lack of procedural discipline and vigilance during flight in mountainous terrain. Improper tracking by the military ATC. Crew fatigue.  Inoperable GPWS.The cargo plane was taxiing for takeoff when a gust of wind caused the rudder to become fully deflected to the left. The captain continued the takeoff despite suggestions from the crew to return to the gate. Shortly after lifting off the runway the plane yawed to the left and collided with the airport perimeter wall, bursting into flames.The aircraft apparently flew into a mountainside towards the end of a flight from Manila to Cauayan in rain and poor visibility.Crashed  2,900 ft. short of the runway causing extensive damage. The pilot was unable to get the aircraft airborne following the impact. Weather was below minima. Crew failed to monitor their instruments, became spatially disoriented and failed to arrest a high rate of descent.

The plane lost contact with the Horta control tower 10 minutes before it was scheduled to land.  Witnesses said the plane was flying very low before they saw the plane crash into Mount Esperanca on the island of Sao Jorge.While attempting to land at La Aurora International Airport, the aircraft overshot the runway, rolled down an embankment and crashed into houses in the La Libertad section of the city. Witnesses say the plane was unable to stop after it began its landing too far down the runway. The crew failed to initiate a go-around after overshooting on a wet runway with insufficient deceleration to make a safe stop. Leased from AOM.Shortly after taking off the ADI comparator alarm sounded three times. Shortly afterwards, the warning sounded a further two times. As the captain initiated a procedural turn to the left, the comparator warning sounded 9 more times.. The aircraft then banked left progressively and entered a descent until it struck the ground in a 40 degree nose down attitude at a high rate of speed. The pilots did not respond appropriately to the comparator warnings during the climb after takeoff from Stansted despite prompts from the flight engineer. The commander, as the handling pilot, maintained a left roll control input, rolling the aircraft to approximately 90 of left bank and there was no control input to correct the pitch attitude throughout the turn. The first officer either did not monitor the aircraft attitude during the climbing turn or, having done so, did not alert the commander to the extreme unsafe attitude that developed.The plane was hijacked and subsequently flown to Amritsar, India, Lahore, Pakistan, al-Minhar Air Base, Dubai and Kandahar, Afghanistan. The hijacking lasted 7 days. One crewmember was killed.While on approach, after circling for 40 minutes and 5 miles from Valencia Airport,  the aircraft crashed into the Tocuyito mountain range and exploded in flames. The airport at Valencia was being used as operations at Simon Bolivar International Airport, Caracas had been disrupted by flooding in the region.The aircraft crashed 5 minutes after taking off from Simara.  The aircraft was observed not following the usual route into the mountains.While on a positioning flight the aircraft crashed into the Black Sea after stating they were diverting to Ankara Turkey.During a visual approach the aircraft stalled and pancaked 400 ft. short of the runway.The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off, 8 km from the airport in light rain. After departing, the captain turned the aircraft to the right instead of to the left. The first officer advised the captain he should be turning right and ATC also asked about the direction taken. ATC then cleared the aircraft for a right turn. Soon after, the pitch decreased rapidly accompanied by a marked speed increase and plane entered a high speed, high-rate, spiral descent and crashed into an open field. The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. The first officer made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. The captain dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. The captain took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because, with a probability bordering on certainty, he had lost spatial orientation. The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive.The aircraft was on a flight from Tripoli to Marsa el-Brega Libya ferrying oil workers. As the twin engine plane approached Marsa El-Brega, the crew experienced a double engine failure and ditched into the sea. Failure of the crew to use the anti-icing system which led to the ingestion of melting ice into both engines causing failure of both engines.The aircraft was not able to maintain altitude after taking off and crashed into a house. The aircraft was overloaded. Lack of safety instruction to passengers. Flaps not properly selected. Took off without clearance.The aircraft crashed into the Atlantic Ocean three minutes after taking off from Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.  A few seconds after lifting off the ground the stall warning sounded and continued for about 20 seconds until it was manually turned off by the crew. Three seconds later the plane impacted the water. The pilot\\'s response to an alarm that inaccurately indicated the plane had stalled. The pilot failed to complete established procedure for such an emergency. Takeoff conditions also contributed to the accident, which occurred at night, hampering the crew\\'s ability to judge the plane\\'s distance from the sea.The aircraft crashed into the Pacific Ocean south of Point Mugu in 650 ft. feet of water while en route from Puerto Vallarta to San Francisco. Radio transmissions from the plane indicated the pilots were struggling with a jammed stabilizer for the last 11 minutes of the flight before nose-diving into the sea. While preparing to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport control was lost and the MD-83 was seen in a nose-down attitude, spinning and tumbling in a continuous roll, inverted, before it impacted the sea.  Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly\\'s acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines\\' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines\\' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration\\'s approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines\\' extended end play check interval and the FAA\\'s approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut thread loss. Cynthia Oti, radio financial talk show host, Dean Forshee, guitarist, Jean Gandesberry, columnist, Tom Stockley, columnist were among those killed.The cargo plane lost altitude after taking off and crashed into a auto salvage yard and burned. A loss of pitch control resulting from the disconnection of the right elevator control tab. The disconnection was caused by the failure to properly secure and inspect the attachment bolt.While attempting to land at Burbank Airport, the plane overran the runway, collided with a metal blast fence and an airport perimeter wall and came to rest on a city street near a gas station. The plane touched down at 182 knots, 2,150 feet past the runway threshold, too fast and too far down the runway for the plane to stop in time.  In the accident sequence,  the nose gear collapsed, the forward service door (1R) escape slide inflated inside the airplane and  the forward dual flight attendant jumpseat, which was occupied by two flight attendants, partially collapsed. Two passengers sustained serious injuries and 41 passengers and the captain sustained minor injuries. The flightcrew\\'s excessive airspeed and flight path angle during the approach and landing and its failure to abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. Contributing to the accident was the controller\\'s positioning of the airplane in such a manner as to leave no safe options for the flightcrew other than a go-around maneuver.The aircraft climbed to an altitude of about 100 ft., stalled, lost control and crashed. Ice build up on the wings. Flaps incorrectly set.Crashed into a jungle mountainside 15 miles short of its destination while en route. The wreckage was found at the 2,500 ft. level of a 2,790 ft. mountain.  Weather was poor at the time.After lifting off the cargo plane entered a steep, nose-up attitude, banked to the left, and crashed. The pilot lost control of the aircraft while conducting a go-around from a aborted landing on the ice strip.  The aircraft\\'s center of gravity on the accident flight was beyond the aft C of G limit. The crew did not recalculate the aircraft\\'s weight and balance for the second flight. Leaks in the heater shroud allowed carbon monoxide gas to contaminate cockpit and cabin air.Crashed while attempting to land in poor weather.The pilot -in-command made two requests to land because he was low on fuel. While attempting to land, he ran out of fuel and crashed short of the runway.

Factors in this accident were: improper planning of the approach, and not obtaining the proper alignment with the runway.The military flight crashed after losing its engines after striking birds,unable to return to land.The aircraft circled Davao airport in an attempt to land but crashed onto a coconut plantation on the mountainous Samal Island. The plane aborted a previous landing attempt because another plane was on the runway. Weather and visibility were good in the area but the landing attempt may have been hampered by low-lying clouds. The last message from the crew was that they were 7 miles from the airport on final approach. Nothing more was heard from the plane. The aircraft disintegrated upon impact near Mt. Kalangan. The elevation of the accident site was about 500 feet above sea level but the plane should have been at a altitude of 1,500 feet.While taking off the plane struck trees at the end of the runway, crashed and burned.During a landing attempt the crew shut down No. 1 engine and declared an emergency. The plane was told to divert to Lyon Satolas. Power was applied to the remaining engine and the plane banked to the left causing the wing to touch the ground, crash and catch fire. Loss of yaw and roll control which appears to be due to the failure to monitor flight symmetry at the time of the thrust increase on the right engine.The cargo plane crashed into a cloud covered mountain.While on approach the charter flight hit the ridge of a mountain. Inadequate crew coordination led to the captain\\'s decision to discontinue the instrument approach procedure and initiate a maneuvering descent solely by visual references at night in an area of mountainous terrain. The crew failed to review the instrument approach procedure and the copilot failed to provide accurate information regarding terrain clearance and let down procedures during the instrument approach.The charter flight crashed while on approach in fog and mist.The plane crashed into a heavily wood area  as it was making a second approach to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport. Visibility was poor in wind, low clouds and light rain.  While attempting the second approach, the pilot reported both engines had quit but restarted one of them before the plane crashed. Investigation revealed indications of rotation on the left engine at the time of impact but the power level was not known. The right engine and propellers exhibited little or no rotation at the time of impact. Failure of the crew to ensure an adequate supply of fuel for the flight, which led to the stoppage of the right engine due to fuel exhaustion and the intermittent stoppage of the left engine.  Failure of the crew to monitor the plane\\'s fuel state and the flightcrews failure to maintain directional control after the initial stoppage.A hijacker robbed passengers, jumped out of the plane with a homemade parachute and was killed in the jump.En route and descending at Whyalla,  at 6,000 ft., the pilot transmitted a MAYDAY, reporting that both engines of the aircraft had failed, that there were eight persons on board and that he was going to have to ditch the aircraft, but was trying to reach Whyalla. Three minutes later he reported his position 15 nm off the coast of Whyalla. No further transmissions were heard from the plane and the wreckage was found in Spencer Gulf the next morning. Malfunction of both engines due to the failure of components of the engines. A fractured connecting rod in the left engine led the pilot to increase the power setting in the right engine, leading to the No. 6 piston being holed in the right engine.The plane made a hard landing, short of the runway and broke in two during a heavy rainstorm.The plane was attempting to land at Whuan\\'s Wanjiatun Airport in thunderstorms and heavy rain when it was struck by lightning causing it to explode and crash. Half of the plane crashed into a farmhouse and the other half crashed near a dike on the Hanjiang River near the village of Shitai, 15 miles from Wuhan. Seven people aboard a boat on the southern bank of the river were killed when they were swept into the river by the impact of the crash.Shortly after takeoff the aircraft impacted another plane and crashed to the ground. The failure of the pilot\\'s of both airplanes to maintain a visual lookout while climbing and maneuvering resulting in an in-flight collision and subsequent collision with residences and terrain.Crashed into the sea during a test flight.Engine problems forced the pilot to return to the airport. However, he overshot the runway and crashed into the sea. One passenger was rescued by fishermen. Major General Santiago Madrid, chief of the southwestern military command, killed.The plane crashed into a heavily forested area 42 miles southeast of Villahermosa. There was fog and rain in the area  at the time.  Flying VFR, deviation to avoid weather resulted in spatial disorientation of the crew which led to descending below a safe flying altitude to clear high ground.The cargo plane had 19 people aboard when it crashed into a farm after losing the No. 2 engine, two minutes after taking off from Villavicencio.The plane, on a positioning flight crashed into rugged woods during an approach to land. The pilot\\'s continued VFR flight into IMC conditions, by failing to maintain altitude, and descending from VFR conditions into IMC, which resulted in him subsequently impacting with trees. Factors in this accident were: reduced visibility due to dark night and fog. An additional factor was the pilot was not certified for instrument flight.While attempting to land at Patna, the aircraft was too high and the crew attempted a go-around. During the second landing attempt, the aircraft was again high, veered to left and lost altitude until it crashed into houses in the Gardanibagh district and burst into flames. The cause of the accident was loss of control of the aircraft due to crew error. The crew did not followed the correct approach procedure, which resulted in the aircraft being high on approach. The crew then initiated a \"go-around procedure\" instead of an \"approach to stall recovery procedure\" resulting in an actual stall of the aircraft, loss of control and subsequent impact with the ground.After declaring an emergency the cargo plane crew requested the nearest airport. The aircraft soon after descended out of control and crashed on the eastern side of the Meduxnekeag River. The pilot-in-command\\'s failure to maintain minimum control airspeed, which resulted in a loss of control. Factors in this accident were clouds, and a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons, while in cruise flight above the airplane\\'s single engine service ceiling.The cargo plane lost an engine on takeoff lost altitude and crashed 2 miles east of the airport.The helicopter, on a sightseeing tour, crashed into mountains on the western slopes of Maui at an elevation of 2,850 feet inclement weather.The aircraft struggled to gain altitude after taking off from Charles de Gaulle airport. The pilot reported the No. 2 engine failed and struggled to steer towards Le Bourget airfield as smoke and fire trailed the jet\\'s left wing.   The plane was unable to gain altitude, went nose high, stalled and crashed into a small hotel complex.  A metal strip left on the runway by another plane gashed one of the Concorde\\'s tires which blew out sending a piece of rubber into the underside of the wing which sent a shockwave which ruptured a seam in the fuel tank. An electrical severed by another piece of rubber sparked which ignited leaking fuel ignited and started an uncontrollable fire. Power was lost to the No. 1 and No. 2 engines which led to loss of control of the aircraft and subsequent crash. Investigation revealed the metal strip was probably a thrust reverser part from Continental Airlines DC-10-30 , registered N13067 which departed Paris as Flight 055 to Newark. This is the first crash of a Concorde in aviation history. The French government convicted Continental and a Continental mechanic of a crime but an appeals court reversed the decision.Crashed on a training flight.The aircraft crashed into the Churia mountain range at 4,300 ft., 20 minutes into a 30 minute flight to Dhangadhi in rain and fog.The helicopter exploded and crashed from a height of 1,000 ft.The aircraft crashed into a volcano after the pilot reported he was diverting to Puerto Montt because of ice formation on the wings. The wreckage was found 15 days later.The two aircraft collided over a central New Jersey subdivision, scattering debris over a wide area. The Navajo had taken off from Lakehurst Naval Air Station and the Seminole from Northeast Philadelphia Airport.  The Navajo crashed into a two-story house while the Seminole fell into a soybean field. Two pilots and seven passenger were killed on the Navajo as were a pilot instructor and his student on the Seminole. Failure of the pilots of the two airplanes to see and avoid each other and maintain proper airspace separation during visual flight rules.The plane was approaching Tshikapa and the pilot informed the tower that it was having difficulties with its landing gear. The tower told the pilot to do a low fly-by for an evaluation and then make an emergency landing but the pilot refused and attempted to return to Kinshasa. The plane crashed 40 miles north of Tshikapa.The aircraft crashed into the Persian Gulf and exploded in flames while attempting to land at Bahrain International Airport. The crew decided to perform a missed approach after it was determined the aircraft was coming in too high and fast. Instructions were given for a 180 degree turn and climb to 2,500 feet. While performing the missed approach the plane suddenly descended rapidly from an altitude of 1,000 feet and crashed into the shallow waters of the gulf approximately 1 mile from the airport. The accident was a result of a fatal combination of factors, including the captain\\'s failure to comply with standard operating procedures and the copilot\\'s actions in not drawing the captain\\'s attention to the deviations of the aircraft from the standard flight parameters. The captain may have suffered a \"spatial disorientation\" to ground warning systems, which could have made him falsely perceive the aircraft was pitching up. He responded by making a nose down input, resulting in the aircraft starting to descend, when aircraft warning systems were saying he should increase altitude.Flew into Mt. Montezuma.Shortly after departing Perth and after the aircraft had climbed through its assigned altitude, the pilotâ\\x80\\x99s speech became significantly impaired and he appeared unable to respond to ATS instructions. Open microphone transmissions over the next 8-minutes revealed the progressive deterioration of the pilot towards unconsciousness and the absence of any sounds of passenger activity in the aircraft. No human response of any kind was detected for the remainder of the flight. Five hours after taking off from Perth, the aircraft impacted the ground 65 km ESE of Burketown, Queensland, and was destroyed. Incapacitation of the pilot and passengers a result of hypobaric hypoxia due to the aircraft being fully or partially unpressurised and their not receiving supplemental oxygen. The investigation could not determine the reason for the aircraft being unpressurised, or why the pilot and passengers did not receive supplemental oxygen.The Air Force helicopter was on a domestic flight when it cashed into mountainous terrain 75 km from Colombo. The helicopterâ\\x80\\x99s pilot had contacted air traffic controllers saying he had problems with visibility and was lowering his altitude. Sri Lanka, Muslim Congress leader M. H. M. Ashraff, 52, along with members of his entourage were killed.The aircraft overshot the runway near Reynosa, Mexico and crashed into vehicles and houses coming to rest in a canal. The accident happened during a heavy rainstorm. The lights at the airport were out due to the storm and contact with the tower was lost. No passengers were killed aboard the aircraft but four people were killed on the ground.The chartered cargo plane hit tree tops and discintegrated while attempting to land. Although the pilot and the aircraft were certified for instrument flight, the pilot apparently continued to fly in accordance with visual flight rules after encountering marginal weather conditions and reduced visibility. For undetermined reasons, the pilot descended below the elevation of the terrain surrounding the airstrip, resulting in a controlled-flight-into-terrain accident.The cause of this accident was the pilot\\'s excessive takeoff rotation, during an aft center of gravity takeoff, a rearward migration of fuel during acceleration and takeoff and consequent shift in the airplane\\'s aft c.g. to aft of the aft c.g. limit, which caused the airplane to stall at an altitude too low for recovery. Contributing to the accident were Bombardier\\'s inadequate flight planning procedures for the Challenger flight test program and the lack of direct, on-site operational oversight by Transport Canada and the Federal Aviation Administration.The twin engine Cessna crashed into a densely wooded area, 30 miles south of St. Louis, 25 minutes after taking off from Parks Airport. The plane was flying in rain and fog when the pilot reported he was at 6,500 feet and having problems with the artificial horizon. Radar contact was soon lost with the aircraft.

Mel Carnahan, 66, Governor of Missouri was killed in the accident along with a campaign aide and his son, Roger, who was piloting the plane.The aircraft crashed into a mountain at 4,800 ft., in poor weather, while making an apporach to Sam Neua.Communications were lost with the aircraft as it approached Mt. Tirina at 4,250 feet, preparing to land at Batumi. The aircraft was seen rapidly descending into mountainous terrain. A large explosion followed as the plane crashed somewhere between the towns of  Batumi and Kabuleti in heavy rain. Navigation error made by the crew in the final stage of the landing approach. Error by the Batumi ATC who failed to locate the plane and conform it to the crew. Erroneous data shown by ground radio-technical facilities at Batumi airport.The aircraft exploded in midair 20 minutes after taking off from Saurimo. UNITA rebels claimed they shot down the plane.Weather conditions at the time were extremely poor due to typhoon Xiang Sane. A NOTAM issued on Aug 31, 2000 indicated that Runway 05R was closed due to construction between Sep 13 and Nov 22. After reaching the end of Taxiway NP, the plane turned onto Taxiway N1 and then made a 180-degree turn onto Runway 05R and began its takeoff roll. Approximately 3.5 seconds after reaching V1, the aircraft hit construction equipment on the runway, crashed back to the ground, broke up and burst into flames. The pilot attempted to take off from a closed runway. The following factors contributed to the accident. Of three lights used to guide the aircraft onto the correct runway, one was not working and another dim. The airport lacked \"guard lights\" used to help pilots navigate from the taxiway to the correct runway during times of poor visibility. International regulations require that a large white X be placed on the tarmac at the entrance to a closed runway, but there was none at the entrance of runway 5R. Whether there should have been, in this case, however, is itself a contentious matter as the runway remained open for taxiing.Due to a blown tire on takeoff the pilot aborted the takeoff, overran the runway, came to rest in a cemetery and caught fire.During takeoff, the cargo plane struck trees, crashed and caught fire. The indicated failure of the right hand AC bus during takeoff with low ceiling. The factors were the low ceiling, night, and the execssive workload the pilot experienced on takeoff with an electrical failure without a second in command.The plane crashed and exploded in flames into an open field 3 miles from the runway shortly after takeoff.  Engine failure.After climbing through 16,000 ft. the crew descovered cabin pressure could not be maintained and returned to the airport.

Factors in the accident were dark night conditions, and the first officer\\'s impairment from drugs.The plane caught fire shortly after taking off from Ciudad Bolivar where it had made a refueling stop. The pilot was unable to tell the tower what was wrong before rolling inverted and crashing into a neighborhood south of the city.The plane was on a charter flight from Jefferson County Airport to Stillwater, Oklahoma. Radio and radar contact was lost 20 - 30 minutes after the plane took off as it reached 23,000 feet. The aircraft crashed at a high rate of speed into the ground on a farm 40 miles east of Denver. There was light snow and 1.5 miles visibility at the time of the accident. Two members and six staffers of the Oklahoma State University basketball team were among those killed. The probable cause of this accident was the pilotâ\\x80\\x99s spatial disorientation resulting from his failure to maintain positive manual control of the airplane with the available flight instrumentation. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the loss of a.c. electrical power during instrument meteorological conditions.While attempting to land at MitÃº, the cargo plane\\'s landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold. A go- around was executed but the No. 1 engine was shut down because of low oil pressure. The plane flew over the control tower twice to determine the state of the landing gear. It appeared that part of the left main landing gear was missing. The crew then positioned the plane for an approach and landing. As the plane turned into long final, it struck the ground, crashed in a meadow and caught fire.The plane experienced asymetrical thrust during takeoff. Rose 200-300 ft., stalled and crashed into trees. An in-flight failure of the left power plant appromately 3 minutes after take-off and inadequate conduct of the crew  so that in short final the airplane stalled and crashed from low height. The failure of the left engine was caused by intergranular fractures of retention posts on the high pressure turbine disk. As a result of incorrect service life recordings the maximum number of cycles had considerably been exceeded.Impacted trees and crashed while attempting to land. The flightcrew not maintaining altitude/clearance during the circling instrument approach. Factors were the pilot in command initiating the flight without proper weather reporting facilities at the destination, the flightcrew not flying to an alternate destination, the flightcrew not following company and FAA procedures/directives, the lack of certification of the second pilot, the operator not following company and FAA procedures/directives, and the dark night and the low ceiling.After losing radio contact with the airport, the aircraft was observed flying low before crashed into a mountainside 2 nm from Jakobkondre.Double engine failure on take off cause the cargo plane to ditch in Firth of the Forth estuary. Icing.The plane was on a flight from Florida to Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia when witnesses observed the plane gliding down and losing altitude until it impacted the ground, exploding into flames. Heavy rain and wind were present in the area at the time of the accident. Weight imbalances in the aircraft were the primary cause of the accident as the cargo shifted when the pilot  got up and walked through the plane toward the rear of the plane, unbalancing the aircraft just as it hit severe turbulence. This led to the loss of control and break-up of the aircraft.The aircraft exploded and caught fire 35 minutes before its scheduled takeoff. Five members of the cabin crew were the only people aboard the plane at the time. Witnesses said they heard an explosion before flames erupted aboard the aircraft. NTSB investigators reported that the center fuel tank exploded followed by the right tank 18 minutes later. The cause for the explosion was unclear. The center fuel tank is located near air conditioning packs which generate heat, and were running nonstop prior to the explosion.The plane was hijacked and flown to Medina, Saudi Arabia. The plane was stormed and three people killed.The aircraft took off from Prinses Juliana Airport at St. Maarten for a 15 minute flight to St. Jean Airport at St. BarthÃ©lÃ©my.

Engine failure.The aircraft returned to Sentani Airport after experiencing engine trouble, skidded off the runway and struck a fence.The plane crashed and exploded in flames in Siberian woodlands near the village of Burdakovka, about 21 miles from Irkutsk. The aircraft crashed during the third turn in a landing approach to Irkutsk, an intermediate stop for refueling. The first officer was flying the plane, when at 2,600 ft., an audible alarm sounded indicating a wide angle of attack. Eleven seconds later the aircraft swung around 180 degrees and entered a flat spin. The captain ordered the engines at full throttle but it was too late and 22 seconds later the plane hit the ground, belly first, broke up and burned.Incorrect actions of the crew. Due to poor communication between pilots, they put in the wrong parameters while landing causing the plane to descend at the wrong angle. As a result, the plane stalled and entered a spin and crashed.After several delays in taking off, the helicopter crashed into the sea, just off shore, after striking a electric transmission tower. The accident took place in heavy monsoon rains, poor visibility and high winds. The pilot stated he lost control of the helicopter when it was hit by a sudden gust of wind.The aircraft crashed and burned moments after taking off from General Bartholomew SalÃ³m Airport during a National Guard demonstration. The right engine appeared to have failed at a critical stage in the takeoff. There were 8 civilians and 5 military personnel board.The cargo plane was taking off from Chkalovsky Airport with a load of construction material and cosmetics. After reaching a height of 150 feet, the plane the crashed and burned 1,600 feet past the end of the runway.  The plane was overloaded by 15 tones.The cargo plane crashed into a hill and broke up. Crew did not follow standard operating procedures. Crew fatigue.The sightseeing helicopter crashed and burned about 3,700 feet up the 5,600-foot Grand Wash Cliffs just outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park. The aircraft was returning to McCarran International Airport where it had originated. Besides the pilot, all victims, including the one survivor, were members of the same family. The pilot\\'s decision to maneuver the helicopter in a flight regime and in a high density altitude environment which significantly decreased the helicopter\\'s performance capabilities, resulting in a high rate of descent from which recovery was not possible. Factors contributing to the accident were high density altitude and the pilot\\'s decision to maneuver the helicopter in proximity to precipitous terrain, which effectively limited remedial options available.After an engine failed the crew declared an emergency and elected to divert to Bukavu but crashed 10 km short of the airport.Shortly after taking off the cargo plane crashed into a wooded area about one-half mile from the runway. The pilot\\'s failure to maintain a proper climb rate while taking off at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation. Factors in the accident were the low visibility and cloud conditions, and the dark night.The crew reported that they had a loss of fuel and were going to have to divert to Lajes AFB. Shortly thereafter, they said that they only had five minutes of fuel and probably would not reach Lajes. The Airbus 330, without engine power, glided for almost 20 minutes, descending from for more than 30,000 ft. before landing safely at Lajes Airport. Several tires blew out causing a fire which was quickly extinguished by emergency crews.  Eleven passengers were slightly injured. The leak was caused by a damaged fuel feed pipe that was caused by interference from the aft hydraulic pump. Mechanics did not completely follow a Rolls-Royce service bulletin. In addition, software mistakenly identified the  fuel leak as a fuel imbalance, prompting the crew to respond erroneously to the situation. The official report stated the cause was the pilots responded incorrectly to the fuel leak.  The pilots acted from memory rather than utilizing a checklist, so they never saw a \"Caution\" note in the Fuel Imbalance checklist that might have caused them to consider that the real problem was not an imbalance but a fuel leak.The aircraft crash-landed on a highway near Ruiz Picasso Airport in MÃ¡laga. While on final approach, the pilot reported failure of the plane\\'s left engine forcing the crew to make an emergency landing.  The plane crashed 1,300 ft. short of the runway. The pilot later died of his injuries.The aircraft was hijacked after taking off from Dulles International Airport. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and deliberately crashed it into the Pentagon. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day.The aircraft was hijacked shortly after it left Logan International Airport in Boston. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and deliberately crashed it into the north tower of the World Trade Center between the 94th and 99th floors at approximately 450 mph.  After 102 minutes, the building collapsed. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day.The aircraft was hijacked shortly after it left Logan International Airport in Boston. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and deliberately crashed it into the south tower of the World Trade Center between the 78th and 84th floors at approximately 550 mph. After 56 minutes, the building collapsed. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day.The aircraft was hijacked after taking off from Newark International Airport. The hijackers took control of the aircraft and turned the plane towards Washington D.C.  A struggle ensued between the passengers and hijackers after which the plane crashed at a high rate of speed into a field in the Pennsylvania countryside. It was one of four planes that were hijacked the same day.The aircraft crashed 4.4 miles from Kura Airport shortly after a normal takeoff. The plane was flying at about 1,500 feet when it began turning onto a course requested by the air traffic controller. It did not stop turning and suddenly plunged to the ground.While the aircraft was over Belo Horizonte, the cabin depressurized, causing the death of one passenger. The aircraft made an emergency landing at Cofins. Three of the other 77 passengers aboard suffered minor injuries. Pressurization was lost at an altitude of  33,000 feet when the right engine disintegrated, causing pieces of the engine to break two cabin windows.The aircraft was taking off from Guatemala\\'s Aurora Airport when it lost power in one of it\\'s engines and crashed to the ground.The aircraft exploded in mid-air at 36,000 ft. while  en route over the Black Sea. The plane then nose-dived crashing into the water. The airliner was brought down accidentally by a Ukrainian surface-to-air missile, fired during military exercises.The seaplane crashed into Mollet Lake while attempting to land. The seaplane stalled at an altitude that did not allow the pilot time to recover from the stall. The stall occurred in circumstances conducive to illusions created by drift.The MD-87 aircraft was taking off from Linate Airport in fog and poor visibility when it struck a German Cessna Citation II business jet. The MD-87 rotated for takeoff and did make it into the air for 9 seconds, but was too damaged to sustain flight. The plane then swerved off the runway and  collided with the airport\\'s baggage handling building, bursting into flames. The Cessna,  which was about to take off for Paris, entered the active runway by mistake, after  having been told by the tower to enter a different taxiway and hold short of the runway. One hundred four passengers and 6 crew on the MD-87 and  2 passengers and 2 crew on the Citation were killed along with 4 on the ground. The MD-87 was named Lage Viking.  Caused largely by human error and poorly followed safety procedures and improper terminology used by the tower. Communication between the aircraft and the tower had been \"in English and Italian,\" as opposed to aviation standards that only English be spoken. In addition, despite the poor visibility and inadequately marked airport landmarks, the control tower operators failed to ask the Cessna to read back his instructions to make sure they were understood. There was no ground radar, runway motion sensors were turned off and it took 20 minutes before anyone realized the two planes had collided.The plane was en-route from Barcelona, Spain to Oran, Algeria, 80 miles off the coast of Valencia, Spain when it informed Valencia ATC it was going to change course in order to avoid bad weather. There was no further contact with the aircraft. Debris was sighted two days later on the water. Electrical power was presumably lost following a lightning strike. Control was lost and the airplane crashed into the sea.Shortly after taking off from Dillingham, the aircraft\\'s wing dipped, the nose pitched up, the plane became inverted and crashed to the ground. The weather was clear and windy at the time of the accident. An in-flight loss of control resulting from upper surface ice contamination that the pilot-in-command failed to detect during his preflight inspection of the airplane. Contributing to the accident was the lack of a preflight inspection requirement for CE-208 pilots to examine at close range the upper surface of the wing for ice contamination when ground icing conditions exist.The air ambulance was flown into terrain during an overshoot because the required climb angle was not set and maintained to ensure a positive rate of climb. During the go-around, conditions were present for somatogravic illusion, which most likely led to the captain losing situational awareness.The helicopter was flying very low because the pilot was not instrument rated. The skid hit the water followed by the tail rotor and the helicopter crashed. The pilot\\'s failure to maintain clearance from the surface of an open body of water while intentionally attempting to maintain a very low altitude while in cruise flight. Factors include falling snow, low ceilings, whiteout/greyout conditions, and flat/glassy water.Three minutes after taking off and while in a climbing left turn, at 2,800 ft., parts of the plane, including the vertical stabilizer and rudder, fell from the aircraft. The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight, investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program, the Board said that American Airlines\\' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistic and exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence, erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight. In addition, because of its high sensitivity, the Airbus A-300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeed.Residents heard a loud noise and saw flames in the night sky as the aircraft clipped treetops and summer homes before crashing into a snowy forest. Wreckage was spread over a 1.5 mile area. Serious maintenance violations and operational procedures were discovered during the investigation of the accident.The cargo plane was not able to gain altitude, veered off the runway and crashed. The (undetermined) pilot-at-the-controls\\' early, and over rotation of the airplane\\'s nose during the takeoff attempt, and his failure to maintain directional control. Also causal, was the captain\\'s inadequate remedial action, both during the takeoff attempt and after the airplane departed the runway.The plane crashed into a marshy forested area about 2 kilometer short of its destination at Kardla Airport. Several errors by the pilot.The aircraft was flying through a mix of rain and snow on final approach, when it crashed in a wooded area, 5.5 miles from Zurich Airport where it was scheduled to land on Runway 28.  At 22.03 the aircraft was descending to 4000 ft. on final approach.  At 22.05 the captain reported reaching the minimum descent altitude and stated he could see the ground. Shortly after, the radio altimeter reported 500 ft. agl, followed by a \"minimum\" warning. A go-around was ordered, but it was too late and the aircraft struck trees and crashed. American pop singer, Melanie Thornton, 34, killed. Maria Serano Serano and Nathaly van het Ende both 27, and members of the pop-music trio, Passion Fruit, also killed. The pilot had been working more than 13 hours when the accident took place and had also exceeded maximum duty several times in the days preceding the crash. A controlled flight into terrain caused by the captain deliberately descending below the minimum descent altitude without having the required visual contact with either the approach lights or the runway and the copilot making no attempt to prevent the continuation of the flight below the minimum descent altitude. The report revealed that the pilot had failed to perform correct navigation and landing procedures before, but no action had been taken by the airline.  The range of hills the plane crashed into was not marked in the Jeppesen approach chart used by the crew, despite the hilly terrain the approach to runway 28 was not equipped with a minimum safe altitude warning (MSAW) system, which triggers an alarm if a minimum safe altitude is violated, and the airport\\'s means of determining visibility were inadequate for runway 28 and the visual minimums at the time of the accident were actually inappropriate for using the standard approach to runway 28.The cargo plane contacted the ground 700 meters short of the runway, broke in two and burned.A fire broke out aboard the aircraft while en route at FL290.

The government plane belonged to the General Office of the judge advocate.The aircraft suffered a flame out of both engines in torrential rains while on approach  to Yogyakarta. The crew made an emergency landing in the Bengawan Solo River, in shallow water. The plane circled several times before diving in a steep course towards the river. The plane\\'s left wing struck a river bank before it plunged into the water. The reason the crew flew into extreme weather was the heavy rain and hail was shadowed on the radar and blocked from radar view. In addition, the airplane had a partially failed battery which was exhausted by two attempts to restart the engines, producing a total electrical failure. A flight attendant drowned in the shallow water when she jumped from the plane.The plane crashed into del cerro El Tigre mountain in the jungles of the Amazon at an elevation of 14,700 ft.  The 35 minute flight was transporting oil workers to a remote oil field.Crashed 2km short of the runway  from the Luena Airport while attempting to land in heavy rain.The airliner crashed into the fogbound 15,721 ft. Nevado de Cumbal volcano, in the Andes mountains, near the Ecuador / Colombian border. Air traffic control lost contact with the plane as it circled into Colombian territory to maneuver around snow capped mountain peaks and return to the Ecuadorian border city of TulcÃ¡n. The pilot\\'s decision to initiate and continue the flight towards TulcÃ¡n Airport while below minimum meteorological conditions established in the company\\'s standard operating procedure.  Inadequate navigation and operation of the aircraft by the pilot in command consistent with entering the holding pattern at the TulcÃ¡n NDB with a velocity of 230 knots indicated and with a bank angle of 15 degrees, exceeding the maximum limit of 180 knots stipulated throughout the procedure, and using a bank angle inferior to the recommended 25 to 30 degrees, thereby departing holding pattern obstacle protection, leading to a collision against the Cumbal Volcano.Crashed against the side of a mountain in heavy fog in the Sefid Kouh mountain range while on approach to Khorramabad. The plane was totally destroyed and scattered in small pieces across the mountain. Pilot error.The plane was making an emergency landing after two previous attempts in heavy snow and strong winds when it clipped treetops and crashed into a field, approximately 1.5km short of the runway.A helicopter ferrying U.S. troops in a counter-terrorism exercise, crashed into the sea, 30 minutes before its scheduled arrival at Mactan Island.

A strong southerly wind required the aircraft to make a turn and approach the runway from the north. The aircraft crashed near the peak of Mt. Mulbong, approximately 3 mile north of the runway. The plane bounced three times before hitting the ground and exploding. More than 1,000 trees were uprooted by the impact. The plane was off course when the crew turned on final. The flight crew performed the circling approach, not being aware of the weather minima of wide-body aircraft (B767-200) for landing, and in the approach briefing, did not include the missed approach, etc., among the items specified in Air Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s operations and training manuals.  The flight crew exercised poor crew resource management and lost situational awareness during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to fly outside of the circling approach area, delaying the base turn, contrary to the captainâ\\x80\\x99s intention to make a timely base turn. The flight crew did not execute a missed approach when they lost sight of the runway during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to strike high terrain (mountain) near the airport. When the first officer advised the captain to ascend again for landing, about 5 seconds before impact, the captain did not react, nor did the first officer initiate the missed approach himself.The plane was being used by the Penitentiary and Prison National Institute, Inpec, to fly prisoners from MedellÃ\\xadn to PopayÃ¡n. The aircraft had just finished flying 50 prisoners to PopayÃ¡n when it took off from PopayÃ¡n to pick up more prisoners.

There were reports of an engine failure and  fire during the takeoff. Prior to the fatal crash, the aircraft involved in the incident had been grounded on two previous occasions to perform engine maintenance.The jet airliner crashed into a hillside, 4 miles from the Tunis-Carthage airport, as the pilot attempted to make a landing. The plane\\'s landing gear had failed to open during the approach into Tunis-Carthage airport and the pilot had made another circuit before attempting a fresh landing when the plane crashed in heavy rain and high winds. The accident was attributed to the rough weather conditions and the pilot\\'s inability to deal with the situation.The MD-82 crashed into the Dalian Bay, 12 miles east of Dalian airport. The pilot reported a fire aboard the aircraft and the cabin lights were out prior to the plane impacting the water.  The accident was caused by an act of sabotage by a passenger who lit a fire  using gasoline in the cabin. He had bought multiple insurance policies before boarding the flight.The plane crashed approximately 12 miles from Calabar while attempting to land. All passengers departed at Port Harcourt and only a crew of 5 was aboard. The premature departure of the plane from the normal minimum safe altitude of 2,500 ft. without air traffic controller\\'s clearance until it flew into the terrain. Other contributing factors were the emergence of electrical problem on the aircraft at the commencement of the approach which might have distracted the  pilot  and unfavorable weather conditions of low ceiling and thunderstorms which impaired visibility at the critical time of descent.The flight crashed into the sea, 31 miles NE of the Penghu (Pescadore) Islands in the Taiwan Strait. The plane disappeared from radar while flying at 35,000 ft. approximately 20 minutes after taking off from Chiang Kai Shek Airport. There was no distress call and the weather was good at the time.

Debris was spread across a 20 mile radius. Fifty-two children on a beach holiday were among the 69 aboard the Tupolev. The Tupolev pilot received contradictory instructions. The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air traffic controller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower\\'s order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev\\'s TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing\\'s TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air traffic controller was telling the Tupolev\\'s pilots to descend. The air traffic controller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller\\'s information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings. Sadly, one-and-a-half years later, the controller, Peter Nielsen, was stabbed to death by a Russian man who had lost his wife and two children in the accident.The aircraft crashed 2 miles short of the runway into the Guitangola neighborhood of Bangui.

The aircraft\\'s lower aft fuselage struck a berm supporting a localizer antenna, resulting in the tail separating from the aircraft, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. The incorrect V speeds and thrust setting were too low to enable the aircraft to take off safely for the actual weight of the aircraft. The pilots of MKA1602 did not carry out the gross error check in accordance with the company\\'s standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the incorrect take-off performance data were not detected. Crew fatigue.On a night repositioning flight, while en route, the stick shaker activated several times before the plane entered a aerodynamic stall. Almost simultaneously both engines stopped. The crew declared an emergency but the plane did not make the airport, crashed and broke up. PC:  The pilots\\' unprofessional behavior, deviation from standard operating procedures, and poor airmanship, which resulted in an in-flight emergency from which they were unable to recover, in part because of the pilots\\' inadequate training The pilots\\' failure to prepare for an emergency landing in a timely manner, including communicating with air traffic controllers immediately after the emergency about the loss of both engines and the availability of landing sites and the pilots\\' failure to achieve and maintain the target airspeed in the double engine failure checklist, which caused the engine cores to stop rotating and resulted in the core lock engine condition. Contributing to this accident was the engine core lock condition, which prevented at least one engine from being restarted, and the airplane flight manuals that did not communicate to pilots the importance of maintaining a minimum airspeed to keep the engine cores rotating.During descent in poor weather, the cargo plane struck a mountain near the airport.A few minutes after takeoff, the cargo plane struck the side Tagbao mountain a few  kilometers from the airport.The turboprop crashed 4 miles south of Kirksville while on approach to Kirksville Municipal Airport. The plane clipped tree tops before crashing on its belly into a wooded area. Data show the plane descending then climbing slightly in the last four seconds before impact. The plane lacked a modern terrain warning system which would have been required equipment the next year. The pilots\\' failure to follow established procedures and properly conduct a nonprecision instrument approach at night in instrument meteorological conditions, including their descent below the minimum descent altitude before required visual cues were available (which continued unmoderated until the airplane struck the trees) and their failure to adhere to the established division of duties between the flying and nonflying pilots. Contributing to the accident were the pilots\\' failure to make standard callouts and the current Federal Aviation Regulations that allow pilots to descend below the MDA into a region in which safe obstacle clearance is not assured based upon seeing the airport approach lights. The pilots\\' failure to establish and maintain a professional demeanor during the flight and their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance.Two minutes after taking off, the air ambulance crashed into Otay peak,  in an isolated area of mountains, 8 miles east of Brown Field Municipal Airport. Dark night visual conditions prevailed. The controller\\'s Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System issued and alert during the last two radar returns. The air traffic controller failed to alert the crew to altitude warnings as the plane was on track to fly into a mountain. The controller identified the airplane on the radar screen and instructed crew members to expect clearance above 5,000 feet, but then issued a heading that resulted in a flight track directly into the mountains. The mountain is at 3,556 feet altitude. Also, the flight crew did not follow the recommended departure procedures for taking off at night and in mountainous terrain. Failure of the flightcrew to maintain terrain clearance during a VFR departure, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain, and the air traffic controller\\'s issuance of a clearance that transferred the responsibility for terrain clearance from the fllightcrew to the controller. The controller\\'s failure to provide terrain clearance instructions to the flightcrew, and failure to advise the flightcrew of minimum safe altitude warning alerts. Contributing to the accident was the pilots\\' fatigue which likely contributed to their degraded decision making.The plane struck a steep incline in the Bull Mountain area seven miles from the Blue Ridge Regional Airport in heavy fog.

There was light snow falling with fog and reduced visibility at the time of the accident.  Also, the pilot chose to take off from a 7,500 ft. runway rather than wait for the 10,000 ft. runway to be plowed. The youngest son of NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol and actress Susan Saint James killed. St. James had just exited the accident vehicle before it took off. The flightcrew\\'s failure to ensure that the airplane\\'s wings were free of ice or snow contamination that accumulated while the airplane was on the ground, which resulted in an attempted takeoff with upper wing contamination that induced the a subsequent stall and collision with the ground. A factor contributing to the accident was the pilots\\' lack of experience flying during winter weather conditions.While attempting to land, the plane overran the runway and crashed through the airport barrier fence, into a rice field, broke in two and  came to rest at a cemetery, 300 meters beyond the runway. Bad weather and a malfunctioning spoiler may have caused the crash.Crashed while en route in mountainous terrain.A forward emergency exit opened in flight causing one of the crew members to be sucked out.

The plane crashed into a field and burned. The plane crashed because the pilots failed to notice the airplane had slowed to an unsafe speed and allowed the plane to stall. In addition, there was a thin layer of ice on the aircraft\\'s wings. The flight crew\\'s failure to effectively monitor and maintain airspeed and comply with procedures for deice boot activation on the approach, which caused an aerodynamic stall from which they did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the FAA\\'s failure to establish adequate certification requirements for flight into icing conditions, which led to the inadequate stall warning margin provided by the airplane\\'s stall warning system.While on approach to Runway 29 the aircraft crashed on a mountain.On final approach, the aircraft crashed into the sea 100 meters off shore, 400 meters short of runway.The cargo plane crashed into a wooded area short of the runway and was destroyed.While on final approach, the air ambulance crashed into the sea at night and in poor visibility.The  Russian turboprop carrying oil workers, crashed into the ground and caught fire while on final approach to Varandey in heavy fog.  The planeâ\\x80\\x99s crew tried to make an emergency landing five kilometers away from the airport. The moment the plane touched the ground, the plane fell to one side broke up and caught fire.  Pilot error.  Lack of coordination among the crew and the blinding whiteness of the snow that disoriented the pilots, apparently causing them to perform a wrong maneuver.The cargo plane, after takeoff and climbing lost altitude and crashed into Lake Victoria.The small airliner crashed while taking off from the Colombian Caribbean Island of Old Providence.

One of the passenger\\'s infant fell into the river and drowned while exiting the aircraft.While taking off on a training flight, the twin engine aircraft stalled and crashed near a petroleum facility near the airport.The plane entered a spiral descent and broke up. It found the captain noticed a fuel imbalance and opened the crossfeed. This resulted in the plane being flown at a large sideslip angle while still under autopilot control, by means of the rudder trim mechanism. Forty-seven seconds after the cross flow was opened, there was a  \"bank angle\" warning, followed by a warning chime that was presumably a warning they were straying from their correct altitude. The autopilot disengaging, probably due to a servo reaching its torque limit. This meant that there was no compensation applied for the rudder trim input, and the plane entered a roll and steep descent, disintegrating around FL 199. The investigation found poor visibility at night in low cloud was a factor in preventing the pilots realizing sooner.The plane was heading for the town of Isiro when it lost radio contact. As it was returning to Kisangani its propeller hit a tree and the plane lost control.The plane crashed as it was preparing to land at the remote Aboriginal community of Lockhart River on Cape York peninsula. The plane was flying in heavy rain and strong winds when it crashed. The wreckage was found in rugged rainforest terrain. Controled flight into terrain.

The crew aborted the takeoff but crashed at the end of the runway.The airliner disappeared from radar and crashed into dense jungle shortly after taking off from Malabala. A witness saw flames coming from the side of the plane shortly after take-off. The plane then tilted and fell, skidded over trees for a distance of about half a mile and crashed. The plane was overloaded. The aircraft was built to accommodate a maximum of 48 passengers.The plane landed almost half-way down Runway 24, overran the runway, broke in two and caught fire. There was severe thunderstorms at the time of the landing with rain, lightning and hail. All 309 aboard escaped. There were 43 injuries. The pilot landed the plane too far down the rain-slick runway making it virtually impossible to stop the plane before it ran off the runway. In addition, the reverse thrust was not employed until 17 seconds after the wheels touched down.The aircraft developed engine trouble while en route from Bari Italy to Djerba, Tunisia The crew contacted Palermo ATC for an emergency landing but ditched into the sea approximately 19 miles north of Palermo. The pilot reported that both engines had failed. Fuel starvation. The maintenance crew incorrectly installed a fuel gauge for a ATR-42 on the ATR-72. Both instruments look very similar. A contributing factor was the failure of the crew to carry out proper emergency procedures once the plane ran out of fuel. In March 2009, an Italian court sentenced the pilot, to 10 years of jail for manslaughter. Prosecutors said that after the plane\\'s engines stopped functioning, Garbi failed to follow emergency procedures, and that he could possibly have reached runway 25 of Palermo \"Punta Raisi\" Airport, or even the standard runway 20. Witnesses say he succumbed to panic and began praying out loud, rather than attempting to maneuver the plane to the nearest airport.The helicopter crashed at sea about 3 miles off the coast near the island of Naissaar, after disappeared from Tallinn ATC radar 3 minutes after take-off from Tallinn in gusty wind conditions. Failure of the power steering system, caused by coating flaking off from servo pistons. The loosened plasma coating flakes blocked the return valves of the servos, causing the aircraft to abruptly lose its maneuverabilityWhile flying at FL340 towards Athens the crew reported problems with their air conditioning system. As the airliner entered Greek airspace ATC lost contact with the plane. Two Greek F-16 fighters were dispatched to intercept the plane. The F-16 pilots reported that one pilot was not in the cockpit and the other was slumped over the controls. They also said oxygen masks had deployed in the cabin. The plane continued on its programmed route to a holding pattern off the coast of Greece and flew in circles for two hours. Meanwhile, at least two flight attendants had stayed awake using portable oxygen bottles but they couldn\\'t get through the locked, terrorist-proof cockpit door. It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromou, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control had been  left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists. They failed to respond to warnings as oxygen masks fell in the passenger cabin which eventually  led to the two pilots losing consciousness and the plane crashing.While en route, the crew reported engine trouble with both engines and planed to divert to Caracas. The plane began losing altitude and eventually crashed in the Sierra de Perija mountains on the Columbian-Venezuelan border. The autopilot might have reduced engine power too much after a rapid climb to FL330, allowing airspeed to bleed off to the point of a stall. Also the data recorder showed that rather than push the nose over to recover from the stall, the pilots held the yoke to their chests all the way to the ground. It has also been suggesting that a buildup of ice inside each engine\\'s PT2 probe was responsible for the accident.The plane was about to land at Pucallpa when it ran into strong winds from a tropical storm. The pilot tried to make an emergency landing without its landing gear on a road near the jungle airport. The plane crashed, broke up and caught fire about 2 miles from the airport.

The plane crashed about 30 miles north of Lagos.  A storm was passing through the airport at about the time the aircraft took off. A combination of poor maintenance of the plane by the ground crew together with a lightning strike to the right wing of the plane caused the right engine to ignite, causing the aircraft to bank heavily to the left and eventually lose control.The military plane crashed into an apartment building in the Azari district after taking off from Mehrabad Airport. The plane suffered engine failure and was attempting to return for a emergency landing.The jetliner slid off Runway 13C at Chicago\\'s Midway Airport, went through an airport boundary fence and crashed into two vehicles at a nearby intersection, killing a young 6- year-old boy. Heavy snow was falling at the time of the accident. The plane had circled the airport for 30 to 35 minutes before attempting to land. The pilots\\' failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots\\' first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane\\'s autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing. Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline\\'s 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties. Also contributing to the accident was the pilots\\' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C.The plane crash-landed and burst into flames in a lightning storm while attempting to land at Port Harcourt Airport. Pilot error. The crew\\'s decision to continue to approach below the decision altitude without having the runway in sight.  It was recommended to improve the training of Nigerian pilots to recognize and recover from adverse weather conditions including windshear. Also, airports and aircraft should be equipped with instruments to detect windshear. In addition, it was recommended that airports and aircraft be equipped with instruments to detect windshear.The seaplane crashed off Miami Beach next to a jetty as it was taking off. There was an explosion and fire and the right wing separated prior to the plane impacting the water. Examination of the wreckage revealed fatigue cracks in the right wing. The failure of Chalk\\'s Ocean Airways\\' maintenance program to identify and properly repair fatigue cracks in the wing, and the failure of the FAA to detect and correct deficiencies in the company\\'s maintenance program. Although a 16-inch crack in the wing had been patched, a more significant flaw in a nearby support beam hadn\\'t been repaired. The carrier had no record of patching the crack.The plane crashed along the shore of the Caspian Sea 8 minutes after taking off from Baku.

While flying in formation with another plane taking pictures the left wing impacted the left wing and engine of the other plane. The plane lost contorl, crashed and burned. The flight crew failed to maintain clearance from another aircraft as they turned to break formation flight while maneuvering. Contributing to the accident was the decision of both flight crews to fly in formation.The pilot of the cargo flight reported he had an asymmetric fuel condition. The pilot  asked for a lower altitude and controllers cleared the flight to 4,000 feet. About a minute later the pilot transmitted six \"Maydays.\" The airplane then descended in  a near vertical dive until it crashed into a pasture.

A distress call was made at FL330 and again at FL100. The aircraft was reportly on fire before it crashed. The plane crashed in a field, 30 miles North of Donetsk and broke-up. Weather forecasters reported thunderstorms and lightning in the area at the time of the crash. The crew pushed the aircraft beyond its limits as they attempted to fly around a thunder storm. The crew steered the aircraft under manual control into an angle of attack that was beyond critical which resulted in  a stall and the subsequent transition into a flat spin and a collision with the ground.The jet commuter was the third of three airplanes to take off that morning. The previous two planes took off from Runway 22 without any problems. The flightcrew was cleard to taxi to Runway 22 and subsequently cleared for takeoff. However, flight 5191 used Runway 26, which is about half the length of Runway 22. The plane accelerated to 137 knots befoe it ran off the end of the runway, ran through an airport perimeter fence and impacted trees on an adjacent horse farm and burst into flames. The takeoff sequence took about 36 seconds.  The aircraft was still on the ground as the plane ran off the runway.The plane came to rest about 1,800 feet past the runway. It was dark with light rain at the time of the accident. The copilot was at the controls but it was the captain who taxied the plane into position for take off. The copilot was the lone survivor. The flight crew\\'s failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane\\'s location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to this accident were the flight crew\\'s nonpertinent conversation during taxi, which resulted in loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration\\'s failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.The plane crashed while attempting to land. The plane\\'s left wing may have come into contact with the ground causing the plane to skid off the runway and catch fire.The NATO supporting aircraft crashed 12 miles west of Kandahar after the crew reported technical problems. The accident was most likely caused by an ignited fuel leak.Eleven high ranking officers were killed when the helicopter crashed to the ground, split in two and caught fire. A North Ossetian militant group called Kataib al-Khoul claimed responsibility for shooting down the helicopter.The military plane crashed en route less than 20 minutes from the end of a one-hour flight, 18 nm from its destination.

While en route the jetliner collided with an Embraer EMB-135BJ Legaacy 600 business jet. The Embraer was able to land safely at Serra de Cachimbo with a damaged wing and tail. Five passengers and two crew members on the Embraer were not injured. All 154 on board the 737 were killed. The flight recorder transcript from the executive jet showed that the pilots were told by Brazilian air traffic control to fly at the same altitude as the Boeing 737 before the planes collided. A Brazilian Air Force investigation concluded that a switched-off transponder on the EMB-135 contributed the plane crash. The report also said flight controllers failed to alert the pilots they were on a collision course and failed to notice the transponder was turned off.While attempting to land, the charter plane skidded off the end of the runway, slid down an embankment and caught fire. One survivor was seriously hurt, eleven others were not seriously injured. Burning fuel in the cabin was the main reason three passengers and one crew member died and six others were badly injured. All six spoilers failed while landing. Even with the failed spoilers, a damp runway and a slight tailwind, there should have been sufficient room to stop. However, when the pilots realized the spoilers had failed, one of them selected emergency braking not realizing that this deactivated the antilock braking system.The plane belonging to Uzbekistan Airways and carrying Uzbek servicemen, crashed after losing control while attempting to land in poor weather conditions. On it\\'s final approach, fog reduced visibility and the aircraft descended below the MDA.

The jet overshot the runway and collided with a truck, killing the driver. The landing gear sheared off and the plane came to rest in a field.While attempting to land, the plane overshot the runway, crashed through the airport barrier fence and burst into flames. The cockpit voice recorder revealed that the pilot and co-pilot were arguing over their speed and wing flap angles moments before the crash. An investigator stated the passenger jet was flying at up to 265 mph, almost double the normal landing speed, while attempting to land. The captain ignored the planeâ\\x80\\x99s automated warning system as it sounded alarms fifteen times. He also ignored calls from the co-pilot to go around and make another approach.The helicopter crashed on Kauai shortly after the pilot radioed that he was having problems with the hydraulics. The helicopter hit the ground about 200 yards from it\\'s normal landing pad. The failure of maintenance personnel to properly tighten (torque) the flight control servo lower attachment clevis, and reinstall a functioning lock washer, which resulted in a flight control disconnect and a complete loss of helicopter control. Contributing to the accident was the operator\\'s failure to ensure its maintenance program was being executed in accordance with Federal regulations.The helicopter was flying low near the coast when there was a loud bang and parts, including the tail rotor, fell into the ocean. The helicopter then hit trees and a fence as it spiraled down into an open field. The fatigue failure of the tail rotor blade root fitting due to a manufacturing defect which resulted in the separation of the tail rotor system and loss of tail rotor control.

A mother and her five-year-old son walked for about 16 hours through Guyana\\'s jungle to safety after surviving the crash.The helicopter was carrying out a missiion with two other aircraft when a rotor blade struck an object while attempting to land. Conflicting reports say the helicopter may have been shot down by Chechnyan rebels.The plane crashed in a dense, swampy forested area, 5 km from Douala Airport, moments after taking off in stormy weather. The plane was just six months old.  After take off, the plane was banking right and the pilot did not notice the inclination, but when he did, he banked the craft further right. The pilot released the flight controls for nearly one minute without engaging the auto pilot, which could have corrected the banking angle, then at 34 degrees. However, his intervention worsened the tilt. The captain grabed the controls, appeared confused about the attitude of the airplane and made corrections in an erratic manner increasing the banking angle to 50 degrees. When the bank angle increased to 70 degrees, the captain stated \"we are crashing.\" The first officer told him to level the aircraft, but quickly corrected himself and said \"left, left, left captain. The aircraft  then plunged nose down into a mangrove swamp.Collided with a truck while attempting to make an emergency landing on a road.

The plane then crashed into Lake Michigan two miles off shore. The plane was carrying an organ transplant team. The pilot reported to ATC he had runaway trim prior to the accident. The pilot\\'s mismanagement of an abnormal flight control situation through improper actions including lack of crew coordination and failing to control airspeed and to prioritize control of the airplane. The event was controllable if the captain had not allowed the airspeed and resulting control forces to increase while he tried to troubleshoot the problem. By allowing their airplane\\'s speed to increase while engaging in poorly coordinated troubleshooting efforts, the pilots allowed and abnormal situation to escalate to an emergency.While en route to a forest fire, the helicopter crashed into dense forest on a mountain at an altitude of 6,100 feet.The plane crashed shortly after taking off into a swamp coming to rest upside down. A parliment member of the Democratic Republic of Congo was killed.The aircraft crashed into Phnom Damrey Mountain at an elevation of 1,640 feet, about 5 minutes from its destination of Sihanoukville.The crew undershot the runway and blew two tires on landing, causing the landing gear to collapse and one wing to dip and touch the runway.

One passenger was killed.The jet airliner crashed while attempting to land in heavy rain at Congonhas airport. The plane skidded off the end of the runway across a major roadway and struck a gas station and building, bursting into flames.  The right engine had a malfunctioning reverser. In this situation, the correct procedure was for the pilot to retard both throttles to idle and then advance both throttles to reverse, as if he had no problem with the reversers. The former procedure, which was changed by Airbus, was to take both throttles to idle, and then advance just the throttle corresponding to the engine with the operating reverser. It was changed by Airbus because there had been several incidents where the pilot forgot to bring both throttles back to idle, leaving one engine reversed and the other thrusting forward. The downside to this change was it would lengthen the stopping distance. The pilot was so concerned about the short and slippery runway that he chose to switch to the old procedure and got it wrong. A contributing factor was the heavy rain and wind and the fact that the newly resurfaced runway had not had grooves installed yet.The cargo plane crashed shortly after taking off after an engine failed. The pilot was trying to return for an emergency landing.The single engine aircraft crashed onto a heavily forested mountain, 30 miles east of Ketchican while on a sightseeing trip over Misty Fiords.

Loss of pitch control of the aircraft following a break in an elevator cable.The float plane crashed on land into a tree, 200 feet from shore, while attempting to land. High winds were in the area at the time of the accident. The  pilot\\'s poor decision-making and inadequate planning. To avoid the rising waves, the pilot decided to take off toward the sheltered interior of the bay, toward the rising terrain, in a direction he had never attempted before. As the pilot attempted to turn the aircraft around, the airplane hit a downdraft, which held it from climbing above the closing landscape and caused the plane to stall about 60 feet over the ground.After a normal landing, the slats were retracted,and the mechanism came to rest as usual against the fuel tank.  On the right wing, a stop bolt that had come loose was pushed into the tank, breaching it.  The leaking fuel blew away during taxi, but once the plane stopped at the terminal, it spilled straight down and ignited from the engine\\'s hot tailpipe. Everyone was able to evacuate but the plane was destroyed.  Boeing, aware of this failure mode due to past incidents, had ordered the nut at the end of the stop bolt to be glued on but to do this, the maintenance technician had to work awkwardly by feel and had inadvertently lost the associated washer that actually retained the bolt in place.Crashed shortly after taking off from CuritibaCrashed most likely due to a mechanical problem while traveling with a second helicopter.The cargo plane, carrying tin ore, lost one of it\\'s two engines eleven minutes after taking off and tried to return to the airport.

Two Sudanese soldiers were killed on the ground.While making an approach to land, the passenger plane struck a mountaintop and broke apart, 7.5 miles from Isparta Airport. The accident was caused by pilot error as a result of the condition known as spatial disorientation. The pilot is believed to have lost the sight of line for the horizon and instead of trusting the flight instruments, diverted the aircraft to the route where the crash occurred.Crashed into the sea while en route. The pilot\\'s decision to continue VFR flight into night instrument meteorological conditions. Contributing to the accident were the operator\\'s failure to adhere to an FAA-approved and mandated safety risk management program, the FAA\\'s failure to provide sufficient oversight of the operator to ensure they were in compliance with the risk management program, the pilot\\'s lack of experience in night winter operations in Alaska, and the operator\\'s lack of an EMS dispatch and flight following system.The cargo plane crashed into a brushy field, inverted, shortly after taking off in heavy snow. Radar data indicated that it was in a left turn at a ground speed of 109 knots before descending and impacting terrain. The plane was carrying checks and other goods for a banking customer.

The aircraft was returning from European Union-led peacekeeping operations in Bosnia.The aircraft was on approach for landing on Runway 27L at Heathrow Airport when at a height of approximately 600 ft and 2 miles from touch down the aircraft descended rapidly and struck the ground, 1,000 ft. short of the paved runway surface, just inside the airfield boundary fence. An investigation showned that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted; most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. The ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel, and should have been melted by the fuel-oil heat exchanger (FOHE).  However, the FOHE did not heat its own inlet  face, and investigation showed that, although the flight was   within the certified operational envelope at all times, a long   period of low fuel flow in an unusually cold environment, followed  by a throttle increase, could cause an ice jam at that point. Corrections in design were made so this would not occur again.While attempting to land, the plane fell to the ground from about 500-650 feet and crashed into a wooded area, 2 miles from the airport.The cargo plane crashed while en route.Struck a mountain at 13,500 feet and disintegrated shortly after departing Merida. The pilots took off from Merida without waiting for the navigation system to properly initialize. Consequently, they became disoriented in the mountainous terrain surrounding the airport, crashing into the side of a mountain while trying to determine their location.Less than half minute after the taking-off from the Oil Rig P-18,  and while still in low altitude, a failure in the tail rotor caused loss of control of the aircraft by the crew.

The plane had flown from Amman via Damascus but been turned back once from Khartoum and forced to land in Port Sudan, on the Red Sea, because of bad weather, before being allowed to return to Khartoum. The accident was due to a long flaring distance (900 meters from R/W threshold) on a wet slippery runway without selecting Auto brake and with one deactivated engine reverse in such rainy conditions. The remaining available landing distance turned out to be too short to allow the captain to stop the aircraft before the end of the runway.The cargo plane took off, reached about 200 feet, rolled over to the right and impacted the ground, nose first. The pilot\\'s failure to remove the flight control lock prior to takeoff. Contributing to the accident was the FAA\\'s failure to issue an airworthiness directive making the manufacturer\\'s previously issued flight control lock service bulletins mandatory.The military helicopter developed a mechanical problem and crashed into a hill while attemping to land.The plane went missing in an area approximately 60 miles south of Jakarta while on a aerial surveillance mission.The cargo plane crashed mid-flight after entering an area of thunderstorms.

One person survived the accident but died later. The pilots  were both working on insufficient sleep and displayed poor coordination with one another. The pilots failed to account for a wet runway and 8-knot tailwind when they touched down on the 5,500-foot runway, and they should have applied a braking system a full seven seconds earlier than they did.Realizing they were running out of runway, the pilots hit the throttles to try to take off again. Had the pilots hit the lift dump right after touchdown, or landed into the wind, the plane probably could have stopped safely on the runway. The accident was due to the captain\\'s decision to attempt a go-around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident were the pilots\\' poor crew coordination and lack of cockpit discipline.; fatigue, which likely impaired both pilots\\' performance and failure of the FAA to require crew resource management training and standard operating procedures for Part 135 operators.The plane crashed in a remote mountanous region of Vancouver Island while en route on a short 30 minute flight. Investigators determined the plane\\'s body broke apart when it hit the ground near Alice Lake, and exposed electrical wires sent sparks into a pool of spilled fuel, starting a fire that consumed the plane.

The aircraft soon after crashed into the sea and broke up. While attempting to test slowing the airplane to an unsafe speed, the plane\\'s computer failed to automatically recover to safe flight, The plane stalled and crashed. The reason the computer failed was that both angle-of-attack sensors were frozen.The reason water froze in the sensors was the plane had been washed using a firehose without protecting the sensors.The plane struck the side of El Yunque mountain 2,310 feet, east of San Juan in heavy fog.The helicopter ferrying workers to an off shore drilling platform crashed into the Gulf, 8 miles from Sabine Pass.The charter flight disappeared from radar 35 minutes into the flight and after the pilot radioed a mayday call. Probably crashed into the ocean. Never found.Crashed while attempting to land. The probable cause of this accident was the flight crew\\'s failure to monitor and maintain a minimum safe airspeed while executing an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident were 1) the flight crew\\'s failure to follow published standard operating procedures in response to a flap anomaly, 2) the captain\\'s decision to continue with the unstabilized approach, 3) the flight crew\\'s poor crew resource management, and 4) fatigue due to the time of day in which the accident occurred and a cumulative sleep debt, which likely impaired the captain\\'s performance.A helicopter bound for offshore oil fields went down about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans shortly after taking off. The sudden loss of power to both engines that resulted from impact with a red-tailed hawk, which fractured the windshield and interfered with engine fuel controls and the subsequent disorientation of the flightcrrew members. Also the lack of FAA regulations and guidance at the time the helicopter was certificated requiring helicopter windshields to be resistant to bird strikes and the lack of protections that would prevent T-handles from inadvertently dislodging out of the detents and the lack of a master warning light and audible system to alert the flightcrew of low-rotor speed conditions.Either shot down or crashed due to bad weather.The plane was taking off from La Guardia Airport when both engines were disabled after striking a flock of geese.

The plane departed from Rio de Janeiro-Galeao International Airport at 19:03 LT bound for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The last radio contact with the flight was at 01:33 UTC.  The aircraft left CINDACTA III radar coverage at 01:48 UTC, flying normally at FL350. The aircraft reportedly went through a thunderstorm with strong turbulence at 02:00 UTC. At 02:14 UTC an automated message was received indicating a failure of the electrical system. The plane carried 12 crew members and 216 passengers. The wreckage was finally discovered on April 3, 2011 using unmanned submarines.  Flight447 passed into clouds associated with a large system of thunderstorms, its speed sensors became iced over, and the autopilot disengaged. In the ensuing confusion, the pilots lost control of the airplane because they reacted incorrectly to the loss of instrumentation and then seemed unable to comprehend the nature of the problems they had caused. Neither weather nor malfunction doomed flight, nor a complex chain of error, but a simple but persistent mistake on the part of one of the pilots.    The crew did not realize the plane was in a stall, were insufficiently trained in flying manually, and never informed the passengers that anything was wrong before they plunged into the sea. The captain was on a rest break when the warnings began. The two co-pilots were facing faulty speed readings from unreliable sensors and repeated alarm signals, but fail to explain why the pilots responded the way they did. It\\'s unclear why the co-pilot at the controls maintained a nose-up input - contrary to the normal procedure to come out of an aerodynamic stall. Normally, the nose should be pointed slightly downward to regain lift in such a stall, often caused because the plane is traveling too slowly. A basic maneuver for stall recovery, which pilots are taught at the outset of their flight training, is to push the yoke forward and apply full throttle to lower the nose of the plane and build up speed. The report confirms that external speed sensors obstructed by ice crystals produced irregular speed readings on the plane. Since the accident, Air France has replaced the speed monitors on all its Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft. The BEA said neither of the co-pilots at the controls had received recent training for manual aircraft handling, or had any high-altitude schooling in case of unreliable air speed readings.
