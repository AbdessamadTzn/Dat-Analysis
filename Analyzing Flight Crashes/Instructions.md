## Flight Crash Data Analysis Project instructions generated by ChatGpt

### Objective
Perform a comprehensive analysis of flight crash data, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover insights and trends related to flight safety.

### Steps

#### Data Cleaning
1. Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. Convert relevant columns to appropriate data types.
3. Check for outliers and anomalies.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Explore patterns and trends related to flight crashes over time.
2. Analyze factors such as location, airline, aircraft type, and time of the year.
3. Investigate correlations between different variables.

#### Geospatial Analysis
1. Use geospatial visualizations (maps) to understand the distribution of flight crashes globally.
2. Explore if certain regions or countries have higher incidents.

#### Time Series Analysis
1. Analyze trends in flight crashes over different time periods.
2. Identify any patterns or seasonality in the data.

#### Causal Analysis
1. Explore potential contributing factors to flight crashes, such as weather conditions, human error, or technical malfunctions.
2. Visualize relationships between variables and crash outcomes.

#### Survival Analysis
1. If the dataset includes information about the survival of passengers and crew, perform survival analysis to understand the duration until an event (crash) occurs.

#### Visualization
1. Create visualizations to effectively communicate your findings. Consider using tools like matplotlib, seaborn, or Plotly.

#### Summary and Recommendations
1. Summarize your findings, emphasizing key insights and patterns.
2. Provide recommendations for improving flight safety based on your analysis.

### Benefits
This project will enhance your skills in data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to contribute to insights that can potentially improve aviation safety.

Feel free to adapt and expand on the project based on your interests and the specific details of the dataset. Good luck, and enjoy your analysis!
